Let's answer the first question first...

## What is linux?

You use Linux everyday, without even noticing, **you are using linux right now!!** since this
webpage is hosted on [github](https://github.com/), and github is hosted on [azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
that is the cloud computing service that microsoft offers, that their servers are based on linux, you see the connection?
**Linux is everywhere!** and you can't escape it, linux is on your cars, roku devices, servers, super computers,
android phones, smart devices, and we can go like this for hours, but answering the real question

**Linux is a operating system just like windows and mac os**

But is a bit different...

Linux itself ins't a operating system, is a **kernel**, and what is a kernel you may ask,
a kernel is the core of the operating system, the kernel function is to manage the hardware
(CPU, RAM, physical devices, etc...) to make it interact with your software, so for example:
google chrome needs 2 GB of ram for all your tabs, so it interacts with the kernel so the kernel gives
google your ram.

The kernel is the lowest level of the OS, meaning that is the most attached to hardware.

**So, if linux is a kernel, how is an operating system?**
And that's a great question, Linux was made by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), who
started linux as a "personal project" and made the source code open to the public so they can opine about it,
but what it really made was that people wanted to work with him! and he said "it's a personal project, nothing big like **GNU**"
(we will cover the GNU part later) and people wanted to contribute to his project with code! and a big group of people around the world
that liked the project contributed with code, and finally the linux kernel was created, here is where GNU comes into place.
