[{"content":"Guide to conquer compTIA A+ This is the guide to conquer compTIA A+ made by Said Neder, this is what am doing to study and get certified!\nHere I documented everything that I learned when preparing for the exam, this are my notes to study and remember what I did, and I passed!\nAm taking this exam on 11th and 13th of april, 2022!\nWhat is compTIA A+? Is the Computing Technology Industry Association, being vendor-neutral, they have been around since the 80\u0026rsquo;s. The A+ is a test designed for IT technicians anywhere from 6-9 months of experience, being one of the most popular certification.\nThis cert consist of two exams:\nCore 220-1001 (Hardware) Core 220-1002 (Software) Details of the exam\n90 Questions Performance and multiple choice based questions The test length is 90 Minutes The passing score is 675 on a scale of 100-900. If you pass these two exams you will become A+ certified.\nWhy get A+ certified? The best way to start in the IT industry, being the entry-level certification, and that gives a feel of your skills and scope to companies that are trying to hire you, a lot of companies require A+ or strongly suggest it, and A+ certified technicians have higher paying salaries that does who don\u0026rsquo;t. BUT IT DOESN\u0026rsquo;T GUARANTEE A JOB but it will help you a ton to get your foot in the door.\nJust to keep that in mind.\nDisclaimer! am already into the IT world and I have previous knowledge on the majority of this topics, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I know them deeply, take it with caution\nResources This is what I used for studying and getting certified, a video course and pratice tests.\nMike Mayers video course ExamsDigest pratice tests Selena Demirci PBQ walkthrough Domains covered by the 220-1001 exam Domain 1: Mobile Devices (IOS, Android) 14% Domain 2: Networking (Switches, Routers, Firewalls) 20% Domain 3: Hardware 27% Domain 4: Virtualization and cloud computing. 12% Domain 5: Hardware and Network troubleshooting. 27% Domains covered by the 220-1002 exam Domain 1: Operating Systems 27% Domain 2: Security 24% Domain 3: Software troubleshooting 26% Domain 4: Operational procedures 23% How to pass the exam Schedule the exam right away! the majority of the exams are multiple-choice but some questions are performance based questions (PBQs) that are fill in the blank, drag and drop, etc\u0026hellip;\nStudy a ton of the resources that am using, a month is enough, and go through the practice exams, that will help you to know where you need to focus more your studying, then take notes!\nYou have 2 hours for each exam, read carefully and have patience, this exam is made to trick you, after the exam you need to complete a large survey of the quality of service you were given and finally you get a big passed on the screen!\nDon\u0026rsquo;t worry about the grade if you pass you are golden!\nChapter 1: Safety and professionalism Professional communication Be on time!! Actively listening Clarify customer statements Maintain positive attitude Don\u0026rsquo;t use technical words, speak human Set and meet expectations How to treat your customers Be culturally sensitive Use appropriate professional titles Avoid distractions Avoid being judgmental Avoid dismissing customer problems Respect privacy! Don\u0026rsquo;t argue!! Follow up to verify customer satisfaction Provide proper documentation Physical safety Disconnect power before anything Anti-static equipment is a most Remove jewelry Fire extinguisher near by just in case (C type) Lift equipment with proper care Tools of the trade iFixIt kits Voltage tester Cable tester Multimeter Cable tester Loopback plug Philips screwdriver Carry flash drives with you always. Troubleshooting theory (compTIA loves this) This is the theory behind trying to solve a user\u0026rsquo;s problem, remember that certain companies have policies, procedures or agreements, and some time strict ones to follow.\nRemember the OSI model\nSteps Identify the problem Question the user Inquire regarding environmental or infrastructure changes Review system logs or application logs KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) Establish a theory of the probable cause (question the obvious) Question the obvious always (airplane mode on, network cards not turned on) Test the theory to determine cause If theory isn\u0026rsquo;t confirmed, re-establish new theory (if possible fix didn\u0026rsquo;t worked, try other one and test it.) Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution If the problem is bigger you need to introduce a bigger plan to implement the solution on the environment, for example: malware. Verify full functionality, and if applicable, implement preventative measures. This could be very casual as it could be very formal. Document findings, actions, and outcomes. Escalate the issue if necessary, but try harder first\nChapter 2: The visible computer System Unit (Case, motherboard, CPU, RAM, SSD, etc) Monitor (Output interface) Keyboard and mouse (Human interface devices, \u0026ldquo;HID\u0026rdquo;) Printer Speakers (Audio output) Game controller (HID) Webcam External hard drive Headset (Audio output) Microphone External connections System unit connections\nBIOS Flashback USB 2.0 \u0026amp; 3.0 (Universal serial bus) Network cable connections (RJ-45) JACK connections (Audio) DVI (Digital visual interface) Display Port HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia interface) Power connection System unit connections in older hardware\nPower connection mini-DIN (PS/2) [Keyboard and mouse] Parallel port (LPT port) [Printers] Serial port VGA (Video graphics array) RJ-45 USB JACK DVI Analog style connector (S-video connector) Laptop connections\nKensingston lock (Anti-theft) RJ-45 USB HDMI Mini DisplayPort USB-C JACK SD Card slot Power connection DVD slot (Optical Media) Inside the pc Question that could appear in the exam:\nGiven the scenario, install and configure motherboards, CPUs, add-on cards.\nAirflow vents Graphics card Power supply Motherboard RAM sticks Central processing (Cooling) CPU (With thermal paste on top) M.2 SSD (Mass storage) Expansion slots (PCIe) Chipset of the motherboard Front panel connections What is a computer? Is machine that let\u0026rsquo;s us get stuff done, thanks to each part of the computer that accomplish their functionality.\nCPU Being the super high-speed calculator that which we can write programs to the CPU to calculate and execute, and achieve what we want.\nMass storage (SSD, HDD) SSD saves files statically with chips, being the newest and fastest way to store data and HDD being with a mechanical disc that is spinning, being the function is this to store programs and data.\nRAM (Random Access Memory) is used when we are running a program since is really fast but expensive as well.\nYou need an Operating System to accomplish all of this. (Linux FTW)\nWhat is an operating system? An operating system is the program that runs the programs to say it like that, and the most important thing about it is the kernel, is the core part of the OS that handles memory management, so it assigns RAM to every program.\nYou need to check the version of your CPU architecture to handle memory, because it can handle it with 32bits or 64bits, so you can install OSes, and programs based on your architecture.\nYour OS needs device drivers to talk to different devices like keyboards, mice, webcams, etc\u0026hellip;\nEvery OS store everything in hierarchical order by backslashes (windows) or slashes (Linux FTW)\nUsers and super users Everything has a user account, because everything needs authentication, since something we don\u0026rsquo;t want to happen could happen in our name if we didn\u0026rsquo;t have any type of authentication so is a security feature, and the way that superuser works (sudo) is a root account which have all the permissions on the system, he is able to do everything, and you as a user can\u0026rsquo;t do that type of things since you don\u0026rsquo;t have permission to do so, this way we control the environment to prevent unwanted accidents and let our system secure, this is called UAC in windows.\nWhy windows is so popular? Since windows is difficult to maintain, you need to pay for it, you need to have anti-malware to prevent unwanted processes, is pure spyware, just why?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just based on a good salesman named bill gates that made it that popular, that was the per processor agreement, for every sale of a computer you got a copy of windows with it.\nActive directory was really a blast on the enterprise side so it made it even more popular, since windows owns SSO (Single sign on)\nWindows versions and editons Editions:\nHome (For SOHO, not able to join a AD, bottlenecks the computer itself, really?)\nProfessional (What Home should be, windows without the restrictions, of course because of the money)\nEnterprise (You can\u0026rsquo;t buy this edition, made for large enterprises)\nVersions:\nWindows 7 (Remember media center) Windows 8 (Made for tons of devices) Windows 8.1 (Start button back) Windows 10 (Start menu redesigned) Touring Mac OS It has a dock, global menu, and for it\u0026rsquo;s file explorer is named finder, if you want to configure something you need to go to the system preferences or the terminal.\nTouring Linux Linux is everywhere, is free as in freedom and free as in free beer! You have liberty to create what you want, there\u0026rsquo;s tons of distros out there, tons of desktop environments, window managers, you name it, make it your own, one of the most special things to check is the package manager, since they are four right now:\nPacman (Arch Linux BTW) Apt (Debian) Dnf (Fedora) Zypper (Open suse) Linux is the most powerful tool made, so play with it! And it respect your privacy under the GNU license.\nChapter 3: CPUs What is a CPU? The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the brain of the computer, which we need to instruct it to process and calculate our problems, and we do that with a programming language, and thanks to that a spreadsheet can appear on your screen or a video can reproduce, and what a programming language does is to convert the source code to machine language, that is 1 and 0\u0026rsquo;s being a byte, and a bit being 8 bytes, known as an octet of bytes.\nThe CPU has registers, that is made to store information that is going to be calculated.\nTo summarize:\nThe central processing unit runs programs Every CPU has internal features to process commands Every CPU runs code based on a specific machine language The CPU uses pipelines to optimize the processing commands CPU speed and cores 1 Hertz = 1 cycle per second 1 GHz = 1 billion cycles per second The most predominant and top notch companies of CPU\u0026rsquo;s are:\nIntel AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) (Both have the same code books)\nThey are quartz crystals that are osciloscopes that calculates the timing for the cpu, and they are placed on the motherboard, and the cpu inside will multiply the time, this is called clock multiplying.\nOverclocking is an enthusiast thing that is to push the speed power of the CPU to it\u0026rsquo;s maximum level, and there are motherboards that are able to to this, but is not recommended because on the long run the CPU will be damaged faster, the system will be unstable and not worth it.\nHyper-threading is a pipeline that can handle to pieces of code incoming at the same time.\nA cpu have a lot of cores, and those cores are like a exact CPU, and inside of those cores it has their own threads.\nCPU\u0026gt;Core\u0026gt;Threads\nCaching Caching is just pieces of the program saved on SRAM (inside the CPU) to use frecuently.\nMost CPUs comes with three caches:\nL1 cache (running at the same level as the CPU) L2 cache (Is the cache that gives information to the 1st level) L3 cache (The storage of this cache is much bigger but the most slow of the three) The most controversial dilemma is how AMD and Intel handles their caching since Intel handles low storage on their caches but extremely fast, when AMD at is side it handles high storage on their cache but not that fast.\nCPU caching works between RAM and CPU.\nCPU sockets CPU socket is where the cpu is mounted and connected to the motherboard.\nCPU microarchitecture is the circuit diagram that is inside of the CPU, and Intel and AMD has their own way to make it, and the companies use the microarchitecture to apply it to a bunch of new CPU lines.\nThis takes much importance in place since a high-end CPU of 5 years ago doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that is better that today\u0026rsquo;s CPU, probably a low-end CPU of today would be much faster than that.\nSocket names:\nPGA (pin grid array) LGA (land grid array) There are different motherboards for each CPU company (AMD \u0026amp; Intel) being that the socket is different, for AMD is called AM4 (PGA) and for intel is called 1151 (Depending of each motherboard since the number means the quantity of pins they are in the socket) (LGA)\nThe most common CPU sockets are:\nIntel LGA 1151 (mainstream level) LGA 2066 (enthusiast level or high-end) AMD AM4 (mainstream - enthusiast level) TR4 (high end - enthusiast) Installing a CPU Please use an antistatic wristband!\nOf course before installing a CPU we need to buy a motherboard that is with a socket and speed-rate compatible with the CPU we are planning to buy.\nPlease DO NOT TOUCH THE CPU PINS BY ANY MEANS!\nThen we need to notice the orientation notch (a little triangle on the CPU) and we need to align it to the orientation notch of the motherboard (a little mark on one corner of the socket) and just place it gently, like letting it go, if is installed correctly you will feel it that just entered in place, but if not you will see that is a bit wobbly or that is something wrong, just lift it up and try again carefully.\nThe majority of the OEM CPU\u0026rsquo;s comes with an OEM fan, and that\u0026rsquo;s really cool since the company that made the CPU is guaranteeing you that the fan will support the heat that the CPU can produce.\nEvery fan has a thermal paste applied, and that is a barrier between the fan and the CPU that makes the cooling process much easier since it absorbs the heat easier, the way to put these fans are tricky, is recommended to watch a video tutorial on how to do it since it depends on the build you are doing but you will get it right, or just try it and see how it goes, make sure is really tight, look out for any type of orientation.\nThen connect the 4-pin connector of the fan into the motherboard.\nNew term: delidding\nDelidding is when the metal plate of the cpu is taken off to improve the perfomance of it.\nLiquid cooling The OEM fans that comes with the CPU are great and guaranteed to work but if you do weird things like:\nOverclocking Crypto mining Or just want quieter fans You can opt out for other alternatives (third-party coolers) that are designed for taking more heat than usual, the majority of them are better than the OEM ones, and they are great!\nIf you want to be a cool kiddo you will want liquid cooling, and is about a box that is attached to the CPU with fluids running that is water with alcohol, and what it does it lets the cool liquid absorb the heat, then return the hot liquid to the radiators fans to cool it out and send them back over, now if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you are doing and you install it not the proper way, get ready to get all of you computer soaked in water, so it\u0026rsquo;s a great option if you know what you are doing, the best thing of liquid cooling is that is really quiet, and it can take more heat than any other fan.\nLiquid cooling uses a pump, a radiator, a cooling block with liquid to remove heat.\n32bits vs 64bits computing This worked by counting how many connections did the CPU had with the MCC (memory control chip) and it that way, 32bit worked great until the 2000\u0026rsquo;s, where 32 bit couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle more than 4gb of RAM, and you need to check the version of your operating system if is for your 32bit processor, as well for your programs, so:\nx86 or i363 is for 32bit x64 is for 64bit x64 is compatible with x86, but not the other way around.\nChapter 4: RAM RAM technologies The first ram technology was the SDRAM (synchronous DRAM) synchronous meaning that is timed with the quartz crystal that times the CPU as well, these type of ram has 168 pins in their stick with two notches on it, these type of ram is the only RAM that you will find with two notches nowadays, and these type of RAM as it was timed with the quartz crystal, the speed of it just went as the crystal went, so could be 66MGz or 100MGz.\nThe second technology was the big leap, introducing the DDR SDRAM (Known only as DDR) meaning Double-Data-Raid, being that for any one given click of the clock (quartz crystal) it can send back two bits of data, being this really fast.\nNow before you buy the RAM you need to research that the speed of the RAM is compatible with the speed of the motherboard, or known better as DDR speed rating and PC speed rating, there are charts that can help you with these but for matching the DDR speed to the PC speed just multiply it by eight since the DDR speed is in bytes and the PC speed is in bits, the DDR memory had 184 pins and just one notch on the stick.\nThe third technology to enter is the DDR2 RAM, with 240 pins and with one notch on the stick as well but more centered instead of on the left side as DDR, this is made because they don\u0026rsquo;t want you to confuse yourself and insert a DDR ram into a motherboard that only accept DDR2 technology, with the DDR2 speed chart as well you need to compare the core RAM clock speed (system crystal) and then multiply by 2 the DDR ratings, and then check the PC speed rating (multiplying by 8) then checking the PC speeds, the PC- is for DDR and PC2- is for DDR2, just by looking the speed rating.\nThen it comes the DDR3 that uses the 240 pin as well and one notch but little off to side to not be confused with DDR2 as well, and then as technology moves on, motherboards get faster so the clock speed of the DDR is now multiplied by 4 and then for DDR3 multiply the DDR rating by 2, as well the PC rating is now PC3-.\nThe nowadays standard is DDR4 using a 288 pin stick with one notch off-set of DDR3, to differentiate between those technologies, and DDR4 is the fastest RAM described on the compTIA A+ exam, but not in the real world since DDR5 is already out but not the standard by any means and it will take a lot of years to be available to normal users, so the fastest ram by now is the DDR4, is the gold standard is it has outrageous speeds, remember the speed chart, being the PC rating by now PC4-, now how it\u0026rsquo;s calculated is different, since is metered in MT/s (megatransfers per second) and that is how is rated DDR4, and then for the PC speed rating we need to multiply by 8 as you already know.\nNow DDR4 yes indeed is the gold standard but don\u0026rsquo;t let that fool you, DDR3 \u0026amp; DDR2 are still used on many hardware as laser printers or dedicated systems, so don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if you catch older RAM.\nRemember we measure RAM speeds using DDR or PC ratings, and the technologies on the exam are DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4, and multiply the DDR speed by eight to get the PC speed.\nRAM Capacity RAM is based on a square-chip, and they are ram sticks that have squares on one side (single-sided RAM) and other sticks that would have squares on each side (double-sided RAM) being double-sided ram the standard, which is why is very common, but you need to check if your motherboard supports it.\nMost motherboards have 4 slots that can handle RAM, and RAM is almost sold in pairs these days, so that\u0026rsquo;s why we have channels, and specifically dual-channel memory, that is to insert the same ram (same capacity and speed) into these dual-channel memory, that is combining the two sticks of ram so that the motherboard can used them at it\u0026rsquo;s fullest, which makes the computer a lot faster, and the slots which should be placed is in your motherboard manual.\nRAM features Parity and ECC RAM contain extra chips to check for RAM errors ECC RAM is only made for motherboards that support it SO-DIMMS are for smallers space (laptops) Almost all ram has an SPD chip that stores information about the ram stick (Serial presence detect) Tools like CPU-Z read SPD information Installing RAM Before installing RAM we need to consult the motherboard\u0026rsquo;s manual to check if what type of technology does the motherboard support, and what size is it\u0026rsquo;s maximum, could be that the motherboard supports DDR4 and a maximum of 64gb, and those 64 GB is divided into the ram slots, that the motherboard has, for example a 4 slots, the maximum you can put into each slot is 16gb of RAM.\nThe installation process is really easy, just verify what channel you should put the ram (read the motherboard manual) and just slide the ram into the slot and press it lightly until you hear to clicks, and that\u0026rsquo;s it.\nThen check in the bios if all the RAM is correctly installed, if it\u0026rsquo;s not installed correctly then reinstall the RAM, check the channels if they are in the correct order and check the speed of the RAM if is conflicting with the motherboard, and then try again.\nVirtual RAM Virtual RAM is just swap, and swap is a partition in your hard drive that is set aside when you run out of memory that partition can be used and save you of a crash, remember that your storage is way slower than RAM, not even comparable, so don\u0026rsquo;t think is a viable option to increase speed, if you wamt speed just install more RAM!\nChapter 5: Firmware All of the devices that are connected to the motherboard need to speak to communicate themselves after the OS boots up, and that happens thanks to the BIOS (Basic Input Output Services) and these are code, because is a program that is built into the motherboard itself, so every motherboard has a bit of programming itself.\nThis is very important, but very, since with the BIOS everything can communicate so that\u0026rsquo;s why we have two BIOS chips, one for use and the other for backup (MBIOS, BBIOS) and the BIOS is the best tool for troubleshooting.\nInto the BIOS we have the Power-On-Self-Test (POST) (More on that later)\nOther thing that is built into the bios is the CMOS (System setup, more on that later)\nPOST The Power-On-Self-Test (POST) is a program that checks all of the motherboard\u0026rsquo;s add ons, runs a diagnostic test to check that everything is working and then it replies to cpu to boot up since everything is great and it reports it by a little speaker that is built into the motherboard as well.\nWhat happens if the post doesn\u0026rsquo;t get as expected? You get \u0026ldquo;beep codes\u0026rdquo; that is the most primitive way to advise the user something specific is going wrong, so let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that the post didn\u0026rsquo;t found your video card, it will output one beep and two long beeps, if the post didn\u0026rsquo;t found RAM it will output a beep code that will repeat until you power down the system.\nIf the problem you have is so much bigger that even post can report the errors you will need to get a POST card, that is an adapter that shows an hexadecimal number meaning each code an specific error, and the meaning of each error should be in the motherboard\u0026rsquo;s manual, and the post codes are only valid when the computer is booting up, after that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean anything.\nSystem setup The BIOS is an ancient program which only weighs around 16 bits, after all these years the BIOS has been updated, and is now called UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) and is a much better bios that is graphical and can be navigated with your mouse, and before the system boots up there it will be the \u0026ldquo;system setup\u0026rdquo; that is a menu for changing some setting into the bios, although not every computer ships with a system setup, much of them does, so be on the look out when you turn on your computer and it says \u0026ldquo;Press F12 to enter system setup\u0026rdquo;, for example my computer doesn\u0026rsquo;t says that, it just have the UEFI screen and from there you can change verything you want, and my computer is a 2020 gamer laptop model.\nNow in the bios you can set up and administrator password, and you need to set up the password because in the bios there are very delicate stuff that you don\u0026rsquo;t want anyone to touch on, so if someone enters the BIOS it would need to enter the password, and then is user password, that for the computer to boot they will need to enter a password, no matter what.\nIn the BIOS you can troubleshoot, enable or disable ports, and so on and so forth, if you need to update the bios then you will need to flash it, so in order to flash it you should refer to yours motherboard manual, flashing can be dangerous, so please read the documentation and know what you are doing, if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what you are doing in every bios they are the advanced menu and the EZ or basic menu, and depending of the motherboard how you can access those menus.\nHow to flash the bios properly This is the way to convert a 300 bucks motherboard into an ashtray in a minute if you do it improperly so follow this guidelines:\nGood power Bios flash image from the manufacture\u0026rsquo;s webpage Do it with purpose Troubleshooting firmware Firmware itself is really stiff and secure meaning it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t break at all, in the past we had two chips, one being the CMOS (Complementary metal oxide semiconductor) and the BIOS updated the CMOS, but now we have a Single flash ROM chip, meaning ROM Read Only Memory, and in computers we have a RTC (real-time-clock) and is really critical, that ticks thanks to electricity, but what happens if you unplug the whole thing? Then the CMOS battery being the technical name CR2032 ,comes into place, where this battery fuels the RTC to not stop, being the battery a rounded golden \u0026ldquo;coin\u0026rdquo; to say it like that, built into the motherboard, and if the battery is presenting problems very negative things may happen, like your clock is falling behind, any type of settings may disappear, or it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t detect some hardware, and all these type of problems could be for a battery that cost 4 bucks that you just need to replace.\nIf you have any type of problems just reset system setup for defaults and it will boot your machine.\nChapter 6: Motherboards Motherboards have standards to fit inside all cases, and that is thanks to the form factors standards.\nForm factors All motherboards have the same, for example the I/O area has the same dimensions as the other motherboards, and they are different sizes of motherboards:\nE-ATX (Mega PC, for threadrippers, enthusiast level) ATX (Most common form factor, big one, 12in x 9.6in) mATX (Micro ATX, medium size, 9.6in x 9.6in) ITX (Small-medium, not so common) mITX (Mini ATX, small size, ) Those are the majority of sizes that are seen in motherboards, and thanks to the standards that are in the hardware industry, it connects the same way all of the sizes so depending on what amount of electricity you will consume you can buy a power supply and that power supply can fit all, since it has an standard.\nEvery motherboard has connections and the way to display those connections in the case is through and I/O shield, and every motherboard has them, and the ports may be different but the size itself of the shield is extremely fixed, so it can fit many cases, of course the motherboard should fit tho.\nChipsets In motherboards that are 20-30 years old, had a lot of chips in it, and one chip took care of an specific action, like hard drives, or a sound card, and so on, but now they are chipsets that manages all of that and work together to take care of everything in the motherboard, those chips are called:\nNorthbridge(Memory, expansion[fast stuff]) Southbridge(USB, connections[slow stuff]) But now, most CPU\u0026rsquo;s take care of what the Northbridge did, so nowadays in actual motherboards there\u0026rsquo;s only one chipset and that is the southbridge and is one of the most important things to know what your system can do, these are so important that their own names of the motherboard announces the name of the chipset that is built-in, since is what cares, since it defines how many ram it can support, how many video card you can install, or how much of speed it can handle, and how many usb \u0026amp; sata ports, and their speeds, etc\u0026hellip;\nWhen you are out buying a CPU you need to know which chipset does this CPU supports, it can make a huge difference, so make your own research.\nTouring the motherboard First, please keep your workbench nice and clean, with anti-static protection, being that a bracelet or an anti-static mat or just keep the motherboard in it\u0026rsquo;s anti-static bag which it came with.\nThe manual of the motherboard is really important, but really important, you need to have some documentation, being that a PDF by looking up the name of the motherboard or the manual book.\nThe I/O shield that comes with the motherboard keep it near and don\u0026rsquo;t lose it.\nThe cables that the motherboard can include could be some SATA cables, and the SATA ports are small, that\u0026rsquo;s why it can include up to 6-8 sata ports depending of your motherboard.\nThen they are the power connectors, the most known is the 24 pin connector.\nThe motherboard manages a lot of different voltages and thanks to this capacitors it can handle the energy, but when these capacitors tend to be damaged it bubbles up and it shows like they are going to explode, so that\u0026rsquo;s how you know that the motherboard is damaged and it needs a replacement, unless you are really good at soldering.\nToday\u0026rsquo;s they still are expansions slots and are known as PCIe expansion slots, so there you can connect a graphics card into it, and the connector is a 16 lane PCIe connector (PCI express).\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a single lane PCIe port, and all of the PCIe ports are serial ports, and there\u0026rsquo;s a 4-lane PCIe too.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s usb connectors port, where you can connect a dongle to have usb ports, that often is the case that includes them.\nTouring the case There are different sizes for cases but the really big ones are named tower cases, and it supports a lot of hard drives for storage, and a lot of space for airflow, the majority of cases have a front panel connections, like and on/off switch, usb\u0026rsquo;s, audio connectors, etc.\nInside the case we have the standouts, being where we place the motherboard and is really fixed by the standards.\nThe back of the case is where all of the cables are managed, cable management is really important since it separates the pros from the amateurs, making the inside look clean.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a power supply area where you can mount it.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s a hard drive bay where you can place all of your hard drives.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s is the fan area where is pretty standard.\nMounting the motherboard Before anything you should connect everything without mounting it up on a case since something could be damaged and being your effort to mount everything up worthless since you need to disassemble everything to fix what is wrong, so keep that in mind.\nNow the I/O shield is a flimsy metal case is really easy to install but really difficult to remove without bending it so be careful and check the right orientation.\nDrop in your motherboard and match the I/O with the shield, that is very important since it can make a difference when screwing the motherboard up, then just screw the motherboard and connect all of the cables from the case.\nChapter 7: Power Supply The PSU (power supply) really is a step-down transformer that convert AC power from the wall to DC power for the computer, and a PSU provides 12 volt, 5 volt and 3.3 volt of energy and includes a ton of connection including:\nATX power connector (motherboard 24 pin) ATX12V (Extension power to the motherboard) Molex (The oldest standard, deprecated tho) Mini connectors (Floppy disks, deprecated) SATA (hard drives) PCIe (graphics card) Old PSUs had their cables soldered into the box itself, so if you didn\u0026rsquo;t need one cable you can\u0026rsquo;t remove it, you will need to hide it at your best but nowadays the PSUs are modular, being that have ports and you can connect the cables into the PSU and you are done!\nThe cables that the PSU has are really easy to connect so if you are forcing it, you are doing it wrong.\nMounting a PSU The way to mount a PSU depends of the case but the majority of the cases is a special space for it that it needs to be screwed in at the back of the PSU.\nCheck the airflow of the power supply, so the fans draw air from the system and blows it off it.\nChoosing a PSU When buying a PSU we buy it based on watts being the formula (volts X amps = watts) but when converting the electricity a percentage of it is lost in heat, resistance, etc\u0026hellip;\nSo you need to do your own research based on the parts that you have chosen for your pc build, being the motherboard, graphics card, or how many hard drives, and to solve that problem go online to a watts calculator determining the need of watts by using the parts you have chosen, and then add a bit more to the result just in case, since the majority of times the PSU will run on less-than-optimal situation.\nHere is where the 80 plus rating comes into place, where efficiency improves when the rating is better, being the rates available:\n80 plus 80 plus bronze 80 plus silver 80 plus gold 80 plus platinum 90 plus titanium Beware of the PSU sizes since they are smaller form factors.\nCooling the system To disipate heat we will need a heat sink, being that it takes heat from another device, the majority of cases is made of copper.\nThe majority of PSU will cool themselves by drawing cool air from the bottom and blowing it out to the back.\nBeware that some graphics cards can obstruct the air flow inside the case, since the way to keep cool the system is by making air move.\nIf your system is overheating it will reboot, so that is how you know is overheating.\nThe downside is that fans = noise, but liquid cooling solves that problem and noctua special fans as well.\nYou can control the speed of the fans in the BIOS or from your OS, since the default speed of the fans is full speed and it does make noise.\nTroubleshooting the PSU The PSU is the item that suffers the most since it\u0026rsquo;s abused from your electricity providers, and it can die two ways, fast or slow, and when it\u0026rsquo;s fast you will have horrible burnt smells, or smoke, and pray that the PSU didn\u0026rsquo;t damage other things.\nThe slow death is the most difficult way to diagnose, if you are having this problems unexpected shutdowns, no power suddenly, etc\u0026hellip;\nNow if you think that you are having a slow death, you will need to test the PSU, and you can test the power supply by doing so with a PSU tester, yea that simple, or a multimeter and the majority of the manufacturers will send the PSU over volted like 12.3V, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay, and if it\u0026rsquo;s undervolted like 11.8 or similar it\u0026rsquo;s okay enough to run the system but if the number is going down well is time to replace the PSU.\nTroubleshooting core components The scariest problem you can have is by installing the CPU, please use anti-static, good thermal paste, have the CPU fan always connected before booting anything up, and place the cpu gently if something JDLK (just doesn\u0026rsquo;t look right) please check what you did and try again.\nOther problem is for the RAM not installed in the proper slot by the dual-channel technology.\nIf your CPU doesn\u0026rsquo;t have built-in graphics, then the HDMI port of the motherboard won\u0026rsquo;t work, so connect the HDMI to the graphics card.\nIf you turn on the system and fans are spinning but no one\u0026rsquo;s home, black screen, no error codes, no error beeps, well the only solution to this problem is start over.\nIf you have done some stuff in the BIOS, or put a password on it and forgot about it and now you can\u0026rsquo;t boot up, then you will need a clear cmos jumper, are two pins sticking out, you just need to make them contact, wit a paper clip, keys, etc\u0026hellip;\nIf you got a really loud noise the most probably thing happening is a cable getting in the way into a fan, just re route the cable.\nFor anything just check the LED that are built-in into the motherboard, that confirm you that something is well connected.\nYou can suffer from bad ram, check in the bios if is detected correctly, and then make a memory diagnostic from a live usb.\nIf you got smoke, unplug everything and pray to god that at least something was saved from the overpower.\nPower protection You can get sag from your electricity provider, meaning sag short term voltage dip, or far more dangerous is overvolting, known as a spike, so to protect from spikes there are surge supressors, that are big boxes that will eat it off instead of your computer being killed, so go buy a UPS (Uninterrupted power supply) that will protect you from sags and spikes.\nChapter 8: Mass storage technologies Mass storage boards media itself in different ways:\nOptical media (dvd) Hard disk drive (hdd) Solid state drive (ssd) And so much more, but these are based on LBA (logic block addressing) and it is circuitry, where is how the OS stores data in the drive, based on blocks of 4096 bytes, so inside the drive there could be up to more than 1 billion blocks!\nThe way to count storage is the following:\n1,000 = kilo 1,000,000 = mega 1,0000,000,000 = giga 1,000,000,000,000 = tera 1,000,000,000,000,000 = peta 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 = exa And for computers would be:\n2^10 = Kibi 2^20 = Mebi 2^30 = Gibi 2^40 = Tebi 2^50 = Pebi 2^60 = Exbi And storage have many sizes!\n5.25 in (optical media) 3.5 in (hdd) 2.5 in (hdd \u0026amp; ssd for laptops) 1.8 in (not common) M.2 format (ssd) Magnetic disk drives They are drives that haves platters inside them that stores binary code thanks to magnetisim and it works by having a little arm that makes contact with it by milimeters\nHow the OS talks to the drive is by ATA (Advanced technology attachment) but what we see a ton in nowadays is SATA (Serial ATA) which is taking place of the old and deprecated PATA (Parallel ATA)\neSATA is a way to connect sata externally (external SATA) in storage devices, and eSATA has it\u0026rsquo;s own port and connector, but USB has been blowing up lately so eSATA is not longer popular.\nSolid state drives SSD\u0026rsquo;s are managed by chipsets, and inside those chipsets there are pages, and within those pages stores tons and tons of blocks, and the chip can store tons and tons of pages, and there\u0026rsquo;s tons of chips in the ssd.\nThe most popular sizes for ssd\u0026rsquo;s are:\n2.5 in M.2 stick SSD\u0026rsquo;s are really but really fast! but if connected to a SATA port is not going to be as fast as an NVMe (non volatile memory express) that is directly connected to the motherboard.\nSCSI SCSI (small computer system interface) is a 25-30 year old drive that used the PATA interface, so it had a wide cable, so this drives are old and deprecated, and we use serial connection, but there\u0026rsquo;s a SAS (serial attach SCSI) so watch out, since SCSI itself could be in some places with the ISCSI technology meaning SCSI connected by ethernet cable, so they still are alive in servers, but completely dead in desktop.\nBoot order If your system has a ton of drives, you need to specify the boot order of the computer so that it can boot of a specific drive, so this can happen if you want to boot up a linux iso or some utilities.\nChapter 9: Implementing mass storage What do you do with a brand new storage device with no OS on it? Just boot from the ISO and click next, really that is it.\nRAID The RAID system (redundant array of inexpensive disks) is a system that makes drives to work together, was invented by some college students in Berkeley which provides:\nSpeed Data redundancy RAID 0 (Striping) Is common for two or more drives, where what it does it partitions the data to save it in pieces on those two drives gaining speed but the downside is that there\u0026rsquo;s no data safety at all so is really easy to lose the data.\nRAID 1 (Mirroring) Is common for 4 drives or more, and what it does as the word says, it mirrors the data and saves it on each disk, having backups of the data, so you gain redundancy but lose speed.\nRAID 5 (Parity) It requires three drives or more, and is the combination of the two leves we have described, where it saves multiple pieces of the data but with a parity program does a type of backup of one piece of the data, meaning that if one drive dies, you can revert the parity file to it\u0026rsquo;s original type, having speed and data safety, but if you lose more than one drive youwill lose data.\nRAID 6 It requires 4 drives, and does much the same as level 5, but with two drives, so you can afford to lose 2 drives before losing any type of data.\nRAID 10 (Stripping mirrors) It requires as well a minimum of 4 drives, so the two pairs will be mirroring, but it stripes the data, meaning it divides the data, and saves the data twice on different pairs.\nRAID 0+1 It requires a minimum of 4 drives, having both pair striped, but the thing is that one pair of drives is mirroring the striped data, so you can afford to lose one complete pair, but if you lose one on each pair that could lead to data loss.\nDifference between RAID 10 and 0+1 The RAID 10 needs 4 drives, what it does it divides the data and saves one piece of data in one drive of one pair, and the other drive of the pair mirrors it, and the other piece of data is stored on the other drive of the other pair, and the following drive of the pair is mirroring as well, while RAID 0+1 what it does it splits the data and saves the split data in one pair, and the second pair mirrors the first pair.\nProprietary RAID Those are types of RAID created by companies that won\u0026rsquo;t tell you how they did it or show the source code (watch out absolutely proprietary)\nHow you can create RAID? By two ways:\nHardware (having dedicated controllers built into the motherboard) Software (Most OS support RAID) Hardware RAID The majority of desktop motherboard include RAID support built-in, just go into BIOS and look for the RAID setting, now reboot and look for the sticky key, it pops up on the screen to enter the RAID setup, and you can create the array, but don\u0026rsquo;t expect you will have the best customization ever, since for doing that the majority of manufacturers will sell you a license, so is limited, and for the OS it will appear as a one big drive, I prefer creating a RAID in a linux OS.\nSoftware RAID You can start RAID on windows with the storage spaces tools, you need windows professional tho, with linux just install mdadm.\nMBR partitioning Master Boot Record (MBR) is the oldest type of partition still in use today, consisted of a bootloader and up to four partitions with one set as an active partition. has limitations to only 4 primary partitions, the way to go around this is in the fourth partition create something called logical volume or also known as extended partition, also MBR limitated the amount of storage of your disk to a maximum of 2 TB\nGPT partitioning THe Guid partition table (GPT) was meant to take full potential of UEFI systems, based on global unique indentifiers (GUID) so it\u0026rsquo;s secure, you can have 128 partitions, and each can be 18.8 terabytes per partition so we have ton of space.\nGPT uses a protective MBR but the GPT starts at the primary GPT header and includes a secondary GPT header.\nFile systems When you create a GPT table of partitions on a disk you need to format those partitions to a specific file system, the most famous are:\nNTFS (Windows) FAT32 HFS+ (Mac OS) EXT3 EXT4 BTRFS ZFS CDFS ExFAT File systems are needed to organize and know where each file is stored this is made thanks to a data structure.\nFragmentation could be a problem with some file systems.\nDynamic disks Is a windows feature, that gives you more options to control drives, and apply simples RAID schemes, microsoft recommends to do this before anything:\nKeep the boot drive basic (not dynamic) Set boot drive to GPT Be Careful to convert to dynamic Encrypting mass storage First you need to check the TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is turned on in the bios, then you need to choose how you are going to encrypt, by doing File-based encryption or Disk-based encryption, in windows bitlocker is the tool that is used by default to both ways of encrypting, altough is only available for windows professional, your best bet is veracrypt since is FOSS.\nFor linux you have LUKS (Linux unified key setup) and GPG keys for files.\nTroubleshooting mass storage BACK IT UP. Mental reinstall (remember each step of what you did to check if you forgot something) Triple check Possible problem: RAID not found/not working\nRAID that is not found, is not created. (is you RAID controller active? do you have the right drivers? can you get to the RAID bios? Are your drives healthy? Are your drives connected properly? Triple check) RAID not working (Is the drive plugged in? Was something that didn\u0026rsquo;t needed to be deleted, deleted? mental reinstall.) Possible problem: Read/Write Failure\nS.M.A.R.T Diagnostic (it is built in any drive, so with the right tools you can check the health of the drive and how damaged it is, the majority of the cases the drive is dead and it needs to be replaced, that\u0026rsquo;s why you need BACK UP) Possible problem: Slow perfomance\nThe majority of cases is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have much RAM, so the computer uses swap a ton, and it causes slow performance, just buy more RAM Possible problem: Loud clicking (click of death[physically destroying itself])\nNo way around it and you are lucky if you can make a back up, replace the drive. Possible problem: Failure of boot\nCheck your boot order, run diagnostics with utilitie- Check your boot order, run diagnostics with utilities Possible problem: Drive not recognized\nPossible corrupted partition table, just reformat the drive. Possible problem: OS not found\nSelf explanatory, check the boot order or install a OS. Possible problem: Attempts to boot incorrect device\nSelf explanatory, check the boot order If you have continuous reboots, it means that the OS is borked (corrupted) and the best option is to reinstall the OS.\nRemember you can turn off/on ports on the system BIOS, check that first always.\nAND BACK UP ALWAYS\nChapter 10: Essential Peripherals Optical media: Optical media is nothing more than CD\u0026rsquo;s, being the famous CD-ROM (compact disk - read only memory) being the file system of the CD ISO-9660 or more known as the CDFS\nAnd there are too CD-R, where we can \u0026lsquo;burn\u0026rsquo; (write) data into it, but then it came the CD-RW (cd rewritable) where you can burn it and then rewrite it.\nBut then the DVD came (digital versatile disc) and it was way superior than the CD, being made for movies because it came with surround sound, and the most famous option of optical media is DVD-ROM.\nBut the best form of optical media is Blu-ray, being really fast and made for movies as well.\nUSB The Universal serial bus is the new standard for any type of connection, and this type of standard has been evolving, being the first one the USB 1.1 (1.5 mbps/ 12 mbps), then it came the USB 2 (480 mbps) but the USB 3.0 came and demolished the other standards with the speed of 5.0 gbps! but the downside is that the compatibility with this standard wasn\u0026rsquo;t great so they came with USB 3.1 Gen1 being the same speed but fixing compatibility issues but the Gen2 runs at 10 gbps!\nThis is really important for the exam so we will organize it in a chart:\nStandard Maximum speed USB 1.0 1.5 mbps USB 1.1 12 mbps USB 2.0 480 mbps USB 3.0 5 gbps USB 3.1 Gen 1 5 gbps USB 3.1 Gen 2 10 gbps USB connectors may come in many types:\nType A Type B Mini B Micro B Type C And USB often use color to show versions White = USB 1.0 Black = USB 2.0 Blue = USB 3.0 Red = USB charging port\nUnderstanding USB USB had terminology where the cable had two sides, the upstream and the downstream being the upstream a type B connector soldered into the device on most cases and the downstream the type A everyone knows, but that terminology is gone since the arrival of USB 3.0, where you can plug it either side and is handled by the root hub of your motherboard (the southbridge)\nConfiguring USB Before plugin things up you should check if your machine has the proper drivers for it, but that\u0026rsquo;s not longer the case anymore since tons of drives come preinstalled on the majority of linux distros because are built into the kernel, and windows 10.\nBut USB has a big security risk like keyloggers, rubber duckies and so much more, so one way to tackle this is by disabling USB ports on BIOS, or use a USB lock, that is a software that would let you know what is happening with your ports.\nThunderbolt and lightning Thunderbolt is a everything-you-want port, charge something, connect displays, you name it, Thunderbolt will do it! At the fast speed of 10 Gbps for Thunderbolt 1, Thunderbolt 2 runs at 20 gbps, and Thunderbolt 3 runs at 40 gbps! That is crazy fast, and Thunderbolt 1 \u0026amp; 2 is just good mini display port, but the Thunderbolt 3 technology is using USB Type-C!\nLightning is a Thunderbolt alternative made by apple that is absolutely Proprietary, so no no for me, but still Lightning is great, you will only see them on apple products tho, but lightning is really slow at 5 gbps.\nKeyboard and mice Keyboards and mice are essential to the pc setup, and making it\u0026rsquo;s return with this devices is the PS2 port, being really but really old but it came back since it has a very low latency for gamers who need really high speed.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s something called KVM switches (being Keyboard, video, mouse) that if you have multiple computers you can share the same keyboard, monitor and mouse and with this switcher you just switch to your desired computer\nSight and sound For sound there are tons of systems to order sound but the most common is a 2.1 speaker system having two little speakers and then a big one for low frequencies, and the sound card that the majority of motherboard includes are great! you need to be a quite audiophile for requiring more quality sound, and you can do so easily by buying an add on sound card for your motherboard.\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t have sound coming out of your speakers the majority of the problems is if the speakers has energy, if the are connected properly or volume settings in the computer OS.\nSound is commonly built into today\u0026rsquo;s systems Speakers systems include satellites and subwoofers, called 2.1 or 5.1 systems. Sound uses 3.5mm jacks or SPDIF Many devices, like webcams or headsets include speakers. Readers and scanners Cards that include a chip to authenticate themselves in systems are called smart cards, and there are smart readers that is a usb device that reads the information that the smart card is holding, the most common example are credit cards when paying something with it on site, the other case is a magnetic reader, that is when you swipe the credit card for example from it\u0026rsquo;s magnetic band in the back of the card.\nFlash memory readers are able to read SD cards, mini SD, micro sd, and a weird size that covers the exam is the Olympus xD picture card, being very popular in the old days for the Olympus cameras.\nScanners Flatbed scanners just scans paper documents and convert into a digital document, but it only reads one paper at a time, but there\u0026rsquo;s other type of scanners being the ADF scanner (Automatic Document Feeder), where you place the pages face up and it will scan them automatically.\nOther type of scanners are barcode/QR scanners, that are really common on inventory of a business, and the scan those barcodes with a tool known as a gun scanner, but QR codes are common to share a website to others, and you can read QR codes with your cellphone\nUsing expansion cards That is what is amazing of building your own PC, you make it to fit your needs and that\u0026rsquo;s why there are expansion cards, being placed on the PCIe slot, the majority of the times the most common expansion card is your dedicated GPU, but there\u0026rsquo;s others like:\nUSB expansion slots Sound cards eSATA readers To insert this type of add on cards, is just as easy as plugin them into PCIe slot, then screwing into the case, and giving it power to the card itself, and to troubleshoot this cards, check always the device drivers for it and check compatibility issues, and the use them.\nChapter 11: Building a PC Understand what type of computer should fit a specific client by knowing the different cases of clients\nThe thick client Is the basic office computer, it should first meet the recommended requirement specs of the OS (middle of the road) (intel i3 with integrated graphics, ssd, windows, office)\nThin client Most common in enterprise, is really focused on network connectivity, so meet the recommended requirement of the OS, could be a motherboard with gigabit, windows, basic applications.\nGraphic/CAD/CAM/Design workstation Good powerful motherboard, ssd, a multicore processor (tons of cores), a dedicated graphics card (high-end video card), tons of RAM.\nVirtualization workstation Maximum RAM and CPU cores, the majority of the cases is a server hypervisor with proxmox installed, and you need a good amount of storage, ssd as a boot drive and then hdd as storage drive.\nNAS Is a headless system attached to the network that handles drives to share files, Gigabit NIC, RAID array. (4 drives are great)\nGaming PC Games makes computers struggle so if you want to game right make it top of the line! A great multicore processor (Ryzen 7) a really good motherboard and a beefy PSU (750 gold watts and up) and you need a really high end cooling (liquid cooling) and a great dedicated graphics card, and add on could be a special sound card (not recommended tho), a must is an ssd, and a big chunk of RAM (16gb and up)\nAudio and video editing A great high end graphics card, a good ssd as boot drive and tons of hard drives, a specialized sound card, and dual monitors, but if you want to make your life easier, just get those bois a mac.\nIN THE EXAM THE CORRECT ANSWER IS THAT THE THIN CLIENT MEETS MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS\nBooting from anything Use an ISO to install a OS Flash them on thumbdrives or burn them in CDs Boot from it to install them or try it You can also boot from a network server using PXE To flash you can use tools like etcher, ventoy, rufus Installing windows Check minimum requirements for windows Back up Download the .iso from microsoft Flash it with microsoft tool or ventoy Boot from it Install it Post installation task Steps to do after installing windows\nGo to device manager and check all drivers Update windows to the latest version You can setup a recovery drive You can setup a restore point as well Setup windows security Windows installation option Clean install: reformat the drive and clean install it Upgrade install: You keep your data and it upgrades the version of windows (win10 \u0026gt; win11) Dual-boot: you can boot different OSes, like linux, freebsd, hackintosh or windows servers Unattended installation: Is a template already made for the installation setup of windows, configured with .xml file made in the Windows System Image Manager. Image deployment: If you have identical hardware, you can setup one computer with what you want and then redistribute it to all of the other computers connected to the network, this is made with windows\u0026rsquo;s User State Migration Tool (USMT) or ghost.\nChapter 12: Windows under the hood What is the registry? A registry stores settings, and those registries need to be read by some programs, the registry is a binary file, and to edit it, you need to use regedit, and the registry is really critical, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have the registry your computer won\u0026rsquo;t boot! That\u0026rsquo;s why windows has 4 different copies of it just in case.\nIt bases from 5 keys:\nHKEY_CLASSES_ROOT HKEY_CURRENT_USER HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE HEKY_USERS HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG Process Processes are applications that run in the background, everything is a process really, and you can check them with their PID (Process ID) and kill them if you want with htop in linux, or task manager in windows.\nServices Services are background apps that runs on startup, like networking, backup, and so much more, you can use the services app in windows to enable/disable services, in Linux you use systemD\u0026rsquo;s systemctl.A\nWindows toolset Your right click is your best friend Control panel System configuration app Settings app Task manager Search bar is your friend Windows 7 task manager You can start a technical menu where you can go to the task manager with ctrl+alt+delete and you can go straight into it with ctrl+shift+esc and you can check resource monitor since is a good tool as well.\nWindows 10 task manager Is the same but with a better GUI.\nInformation and configuration tools System information (msinfo32) System configuration (msconfig) Active Directory repair System System protection Advanced system settings Microsoft management console (mmc) Performance Monitor Is a tool that logs your performance to see how many resources you use on your daily use and then to calculate how to counter that.\nPerformance baseline gives you an idea as to how your system runs Performance monitor uses counters to monitor your system Use data collector sets to create logs over extended time periods Event viewer Event viewer is a log viewer to see what is happening in your computer, and you can customize it, with local security policy that creates audit policies for your system, and with that we can create more logs.\nTools for programmers There are tools used for programmers in windows for example Open Database connectivity (ODBC) for SQL databases, and you can use component services to edit COM features (component object model)\nChapter 13: Users and groups NTFS is great with permissions NTFS permissions can be assigned A group is a container for user accounts Permissions are assigned to groups for easy administration Managing Users and groups In windows users can be involved in two groups:\nStandard user Administrator An administrator has admin permissions in his account and standard user is just a user, you can create this users and groups in control panel, and in local users and groups you have the most control over.\nNTFS Permissions You can go to properties and check security and sharing options, there are different NTFS permissions but are really based on RWX (Read, Write, eXecute), inheritance is stopped with deny keyword.\nLinux and MacOS permissions This is based on the scheme of:\nUser (Owner) Groups All (Everyone) Based on the RWX scheme.\nSharing resources Network shares anounces folders and files that will be shared in the network with share permissions, is a quick solution, since NTFS permissions are most powerful, and shared resources can be mapped to a drive letter.\nSecurity policy These are security rules that are followed, you can open local security policy to find:\nAccount policies Local policies Windows defender firewall Network manager policies Public Key policies Software restriction policies Application control policies IP security policies Advanced audit policy config Here you can create passwords policies, and more, if you are connected to a domain you can\u0026rsquo;t change some policies is because your domain administrator created domain policies.\nChapter 14: Maintaining and Optimizing operating systems Patch managment That is to setup automatic updates and patches, in windows update section, in Linux you can use your package manager of your distro to update.\nWorking with disks You should do error checking and optimization in disks often, in windows this is made with chkdsk\nWorking with applications To remove programs you can go to control panel in programs and features, it can lead to residue in the system, then you can clean it with software like CCleaner.\nSystem restore You can access it\u0026rsquo;s properties in system properties and create/remove restore points, create strategic restore points to not bloat the system, this is useful since you can access restore point in winRE.\nBacking up files You can schedule back ups (snapshots) and a external backup to save the data, then you can go to windows backup and restore page and set it up, finally you can restore from it in winRE as well.\nTask scheduler This is a program that able us to schedule tasks to do like back ups, cleaners, and more.\nChapter 15: Working with the terminal Am not going to take notes of this because I already know this really but really well, going to take notes here and there.\nWorking with drives The format command formats partitions chkdsk fixes formatted partitions sfc repairs critical windows files based on the system store dism repairs critical windows files based on online system stores diskpart partitions drives Troubleshooting operating systems winRE You can go to winRE with a bootable image of windows, and you can troubleshoot a ton with it, you can get a terminal if you want.\nAdvanced window startup options You can go to recovery \u0026gt; advanced startup and you will be on the automatic repair screen, it will allow you to boot from safe mode and much more stuff!\nTroubleshooting boot problems Black screen Is the computer turned on? boot order? did you do something? undo it!

Application running slow Repair application with setup or reinstall Services are failed to start restart the service, check event viewer Kernel Panic The famous kernel panic or windows BSOD (blue screen of death) and is just something that the OS couldn\u0026rsquo;t handle and it just dies in front of you or sometiimes is funny and says things like \u0026ldquo;bailing out, you are on your own, good luck\u0026rdquo; in case of linux.\nBSOD are caused by hardware in most cases, do research. update the hardware and/or firmware, boot into safe boot and check event viewer.\nChapter 17: Display technologies A monitor is composed of individual picture elements (pixels), and the total pixels across and down is the resolution Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors use liquid crystals to allow light to pass or not for each color in a pixel LCD backlights are fluorescent or LED lights and shine through the liquid crystal Organic led (OLED) doesn\u0026rsquo;t use a backlight, as the pixels make their own light Digital light processing (DLP) uses a grid of tiny mirrors that shine through a color wheel to create an image LCD breakdown Inside a monitor, there\u0026rsquo;s the LCD screens with really thin layers that are it\u0026rsquo;s wires that connects into the monitor itself, and then before that there\u0026rsquo;s a big white layer that behind are the fluorescent tubes (CCFL), that needs AC power, so inside the monitors there are mini power supplies, but as the CCFL needs AC, it changes AC from the wall to DC and inverts it to AC again, so this process is called inverter, so when a monitor is an inverter you know it has CCFL tubes inside it, when LED don\u0026rsquo;t need inverters, so you have:\nPanel Backlight unit Connectors Input from data Power connection Graphics cards and connections The graphics processing unit (GPU) AKA video card, and those GPU\u0026rsquo;s need RAM to keep track of every single pixel electronically and that\u0026rsquo;s called frame buffering, but in today\u0026rsquo;s world instead of pixels are figures itself that the computer uses a lot, so it keeps it on memory, and inside the card itself there\u0026rsquo;s is the memory chips.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s three big competitors:\nNvidia AMD Intel Although intel does not sell dedicated gpu\u0026rsquo;s, they do sell iGPU\u0026rsquo;s (integrated graphics) meaning that the graphics itself are integrated into the CPU itself, so that\u0026rsquo;s why you see a HDMI port soldered into the motherboard, for those cases, and AMD does it too and when they do they call it APU.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s common to see a lot of GPU\u0026rsquo;s with tons of memory like 8gb (known as VRAM) in high end GPU\u0026rsquo;s, and you have to connect them some point to the monitor so the most common connections are:\nVGA (Video graphics array)[Analog] DVI (Digital visual interface) DVI-I (Digital and analog) DVI-D (Only digital) HDMI (High-Definition multimedia interface)[Audio and video] Mini-HDMI Display Port Mini display port Connecting a GPU The same thing with expansion cards, connect into a PCIe slot, screw it in, and connect into a monitor, check the bios that you are booting from that specific PCIe slot, then check the resolution in your settings, and finally update the drivers of the GPU, or/and install the utility software from the GPU company.\nProjectors Is just like a monitor, and they use for technologies DLP, and LCD, being the most common ones, but they have a special spec, being the lumens, a lumen is the brightness quantity of the projector, so if you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough lumens is not going to look good.\nYou need to check the \u0026rsquo;throw\u0026rsquo; of the projector being the range of distance the projector should be on to have a quality image, so check that to suit your needs.\nThere are geometrical figures like pincushion, keystone, and skew, that is the way the projector shows the image onto the screen, so if you have those errors, you need to check the menu that is on the projector itself.\nResolution and aspect ratios 4:3 =\nVGA (640X480) SVGA (800X600) SXGA (1280x1024) UXGA (1600X1200) 16:10 golden ratio =\nWSXGA (1440X900) WUXGA (1920x1200) 4K ratios =\nClassic 4K (3840X2160) 5K (5120x2880) Multi-monitors In settings you can go to display settings and setup the master monitor and organize your workflow by extending or duplicating.\nTroubleshooting monitor Overheat shutdowns Not proper cooling for your video card. Dead pixels No fix for that, return it if it\u0026rsquo;s on warranty or replace it. Artifacts Delays on removing the image, check the gpu ram by replacing it and seeing if it still happening, no fix. Incorrect color patterns Check your cable, specifically if it\u0026rsquo;s VGA.

Chapter 18: Networking Let\u0026rsquo;s go baby!\nLAN The local area network, and the majority of the cases are computers, printers, and laptops all connected to a switch or if it\u0026rsquo;s wireless a WAP (wireless access point) being cabled by ethernet, the standard in today\u0026rsquo;s age, and with ethernet you can only send 15 mb chunks of data, and that\u0026rsquo;s called a frame.\nWe Identify every device in the network with the MAC adress (media access control) which is a 48 bit address, and is always manifested as 12 hexadecimal characters, and the first 6 decimal characters are called the OEM ID, use ipconfig on windows or ifconfig(deprecated) (ip) on linux\nHub vs switch In short words, switches and hubs look alike, but hubs are dumb since if one computer sends a packet through the network to a specific computer, it will not only send the packet to the receiver but to all of the rest in the network as well, it just repeats and sends it to everyone when a switch sends it to the specific computer by using MAC addresses.\nThe problem with hubs is that if there\u0026rsquo;s other computers talking to each other it will make the connection really slow since the hub just repeats, so it will make insignificant replies.\nSwitches are really smart because the switch knows the mac addresses of each device on the network automatically, so it knows exactly where to send it, and provide full bandwidth for all nodes.\nHubs are deprecated.\nHexadecimal Is a base-16 numbering system, so if we check the combinations of a 4 digit binary system (only ones and zeroes), it will sum up til 16, so you can replace each combination with a letter until the f, being hexadecimal counted like so: 0123456789abcdef since we don\u0026rsquo;t want two digit numbers like 10 since it could mean \u0026ldquo;on and off\u0026rdquo; so that\u0026rsquo;s why, and hexadecimal remember, represents 4 binary values, so if you have a mac address which hexadecimal value is 12 characters long, that means is a 48 bit address.\nWANs and routers. The ethernet standard says that you will not put more that 1024 computers on the same switch or interlinked switches, because the network will become overloaded, but really that problem will occur with 20-30 computers.\nThere the WAN comes into place (wide area network) and is based on the idea that what happens when different LANs want to connect each other without overloading the network, then we will create a WAN with a router, being the router who connects those LANs together and know what data needs to go to which LAN.\nWe need to configure the router to know what computers are from what LAN, and that is called logical addressing, being the logical addressing IP addressing in the local area network, where the three first octects are the same, but the final octect determines which device is which, and when a device wants to communicate to another device that is not on the network it will connect to another LAN, being from the ISP that will connect you where you need to go.\nThis sounds complicated but all of this is already automated, with a DHCP server that assign automatically IP addresses of the devices on the network.\nSo addressing is divided by two things, mac addresses (physical addressing) and IP addresses (logical addressing) and a router can connect multiple LANs to make a WAN.\nCables and connectors Ethernet is the go to in today\u0026rsquo;s age, but there\u0026rsquo;s DOCSIS (used for cable modems), and there\u0026rsquo;s different versions of ethernet like 10BaseT (10 mbps baseband twisted pair) or 1000BaseT, or 10gbBaseT, and so on.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start from oldest to newest:\nCoaxial cable Is still common to see coaxial cables, and coaxial have RG rating like:\nRG-58 (Oldest) RG-59 (Common) RG-6 (Common) And this type of cables are connected with and F-type connectors, that are your typical cable coming through the wall to connect your TV and such, but for RG-58, there\u0026rsquo;s the BNC connector which is old and it was thinner and you need to twist it to connect.\nTwisted pairs The predominant type of cable is twisted pair and there\u0026rsquo;s different types of this cables like UTP (Unshielded twisted pair) where is no protection for the 4 twisted pairs, or telephone cable with two pairs and its connector is a RJ-11, where compared with the still standard RJ-45, the RJ-45 has 8 contacts where the RJ-11 only has 4 and they are twisted in pairs so it can propagate the signal better, and they run till 100m, being from your switch to your router.\nAnother type of twisted pairs are STP (Shielded twisted pairs) where there\u0026rsquo;s metal covering the inside and the connector of the cable managing interference just great, and don\u0026rsquo;t forget CAT ratings (category ratings) where is designed to know how much load it can support:\nCAT 5 (100 mbps) CAT5e (1gb) CAT 6 (10gbps for 55mt, or 1gb for 100 mts) CAT 6a (10 gbps for 100mts) The new kid of the block uses fiber optic, which is the best option since it uses light, so it goes to the speed of light literally, by reflecting inside of the cable with really tiny fiber glass, and for the provider of the light could be multimode (LED) common for houses, or singlemode (Lasers) for many kilometers of distance, and fiber just accomplish one function, sending or receiving, so one cable for one of those.\nThe majority of these cables are covered in plastic, and plastic can burn so there\u0026rsquo;s plenum ratings (being plenum what is between your drop ceiling and the actual ceiling) rated on how much they can resist fire:\nPVC (Non-plenum) Riser rated Plenum rated Crimping cable Crimps are the connectors, and you should be comfortable with crimping cable, and you need to match up the connector with the category the cable is, so RJ-45 for cat 5 with a cat 5 cable, and there\u0026rsquo;s specific colors that match a standard, being for example:\nTIA568A TIA568B Most connectors have a tab, and starting from the right you read the pins of the connector, check online the chart of each standard on how to do it, and if you make one side type A and the other side type B that\u0026rsquo;s called crossed cables and they are quite handy because that way you can connect two computers without a switch, and they would be able to communicate, and the same type on both ends is called straight-through, and all of this is made with a punchdown.\nStructured cable This is that you need to put your cables inside the walls since you don\u0026rsquo;t want cables all over the place nor people stepping on your cables damaging the reliability of the data, so structured cable starts with the MDF (Main distribution frame) where all of the equipment will be, and it\u0026rsquo;s a rack where the most standard is 19 inch rack, and you can size the rack with \u0026lsquo;u\u0026rsquo; which is the standard size of a switch in a rack, and we will have horizontal runs that really is ethernet ports on your wall outlet to the back of the rack that is called a patch panel that are numbered ports that connect to your switch, and the maximum horizontal run is 90 mts, and you can test your cables with a cable tester.\nIf you have no idea where the cables are going you need a fox and a hound, being the fox a tone generator and the hound a tone probe.\nIf you need to know how long the cable is you will need a TDR (Time domain reflectometer) and it uses the speed of light to know how long is the cable, and this test is handy to know if a cable has broken down.\nAnd the cable that we put to the walls itself are solid core, that is solid piece of copper and is reliable, and for the patch is stranded so is flexible and it won\u0026rsquo;t be broken.\nNetwork card Troubleshooting Install the NIC and go to device manager to check the drivers of the NIC, so you can configure half-duplex or full-duplex speeds (leave it on auto) and Wake-On-LAN that is if a computer is sleeping and it receives a packet wake the computer on, that is with a special packet called magic packet, check the bios if the NIC is enabled.\nIf your computer is connected to a switch it will have three lights:\nConnected Speed Activity So check the lights in your NIC and in your switch!\nChapter 19: Local Area Networking TCP/IP The IP number is made of 4 octets, meaning that an octet could go from 1, to 255, so the IP adress following the quantity differentiate in classes like:\nIP examples Classes 192.168.93.x Class C (home routing) 192.12.x.x Class B (Businesses) 9.x.x.x Class A (enterprise) Meaning the octet how many devices they can actually have, so a Class C addressing can have up to 254 devices, and class B can have 65,534 hosts, and the class A are in the millions.\nAn IP address never ends on 255, or 0, and no more than 254, since if you put a 0 it means as an identifier of an entire LAN.\nThe internet was created with the ARPANET basis, and TCP/IP was adopted as protocol for ARPANET.\nNetworks IDs and subnets masks. IP addresses (internet protocol) version 4 is what built the internet itself but now we have an improved version being IPv6, but let\u0026rsquo;s save that for later, being the subnet the amount of devices that we can have on the network or know as netmask, and then the default gateway that is our router, and knowing that we can configure our first static ip address, where we need to input the values ourselves, in windows you can go to control panel and you will find what you need, so manual settings means static IP.\nSpecial addresses How to identify classes in IP addresses in an old fashioned way:\nClass A = 1-126.0.0.0 Class B = 128-191.X.0.0 Class C = 192-223.X.X.0 But there\u0026rsquo;s two more classes:\nClass D = 224.X.X.X Class E = 240.X.X.X Being a class D multicast, and class E is reserved.\nPrivate IP addresses are the folks who wants their own TCP/IP protocol at home, their own internet without the big internet:\nClass A = 10.X.X.X Class B = 172.16.X.X Class C = 192.168.X.X And we can\u0026rsquo;t forget about Loopback IP address, the famous 127.0.0.1 and it refers to your own system, to your own network card.\nNAT IPv4 addresses ran out in the 90\u0026rsquo;s, that quick, so thanks to Network address translation (NAT) we made magic possible, before in the 80\u0026rsquo;s, 90\u0026rsquo;s, each device was assigned a public IP, and that was wasteful, and complex since it was public so a firewall needed to be configured as well, but then NAT came in, that made it possible to make private IP addresses talk to the internet, since private IP addresses are just for the LAN, it can\u0026rsquo;t go outside, so when they need to the send the packet to the default gateway, and the default gateway replaces the private IP with his own public IP to communicate, and when the packet comes back the router remembered and logged what private IP sent the packet to give it to the proper IP, and that\u0026rsquo;s how it works, so what an ISP is selling you is an public IP, and not tons of public IPs for each of your devices, the down side is that you can\u0026rsquo;t host any type of web server or other type of servers since the LAN is invisible to the internet, and every home router comes with NAT enabled by default.\nDHCP The dynamic host configuration protocol address IP to each device on the LAN automatically, and this is completely automatic, so no need to worry to configure manually IP addresses, but what happens if your DHCP server goes down? You have APIPA (Automatic private IP addressing) that is a fallback from your OS to assign you an IP address.\nAPIPA will always give 169.254.X.X so check that in your IP settings, and if you have limited connectivity, that means you have a DHCP server problem.\nIPv6 Is an IP address with 8 octets meaning they use a 128-bit scheme, and with hexadecimal notation, and for each octet that has 4 zeroes on it is just simplified to just 1 zero, for example: 2001:0:0:1:0:0:0:8a2e And if it was 3 following octets with zeroes on it, that would be: 2001:0:0:1::8a2e\nThe IPv6 protocol will create a minimum of two IP\u0026rsquo;s for you system:\nLink-local (fe80:0000:0000:0000:x:x:x:x) (local connections) Internet Address (global unicast address) Being made the first half by the router, and the second half generated of your OS. In the exam you need to differentiate an IPv4 from an IPv6:\nIPv4 is only one address and a subnet mask IPv6 the prefix length is fixed at /64 (first half) Port numbers So when sending and receiving data back and forth you need the IP of the other computer, and you need the port number so we can send that information to the correct application for example a web server (80, 443) and port numbers go through 0 all the way up to 65535, and for ports is similar with IP addresses, you need the source port and the destination port, for example visiting a web site in your browser opens a source port, being 23-337 and the server of the website you are visiting to being HTTPS will be listening on port 445, and when the data arrives the server switches the IP\u0026rsquo;s, and the ports and that\u0026rsquo;s how it works.\nThe number of ports running from 0-1024 are \u0026ldquo;well known\u0026rdquo; ports, running things like the web, file servers, mail servers, and many things that no one never wants them to run this port numbers without fulfilling it\u0026rsquo;s purpose.\nThe other range from 1024-49151 are registered ports, where other applications registered their ports for specific things, for example steam, so no one use those types of ports either.\nThe last range between 49152-65535 is a dynamic/ephemeral port number.\nPort numbers you need to know 21 FTP 22 SSH 23 TELNET 25 SMTP 53 DNS 80 HTTP 110 POP3 161-162 SNMP 143 IMAP 443 HTTPS 3389 RDP 137-139 NETBIOS/NETBT 445 SMB/CIFS 427 SLP 548 AFP 67-68 DHCP 389 LDAP TCP, UDP \u0026amp; ICMP This are protocols, that are the specific rules and how to do a specific task, to make an standard between all devices, for example the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a very common protocol for the majority of things we use, because TCP is a connection based protocol, being very reliable for getting data sent and received, it\u0026rsquo;s purpose is to not get data loss at any point since it\u0026rsquo;s based on connection, if both computers are ready to connect and have a well established connection, they can talk, where\u0026rsquo;s UDP is connectionless protocol (User datagram protocol) so the UDP protocol doesn\u0026rsquo;t care if the server is not ready it just goes for it and see if it get a response, and ICMP (Internet control message protocol) is only a single packet trasnfer, and that is what the ping command uses for protocol for example.\nWhen establishing a connection over one of these protocols, the data that the protocol cares about is a PDU (Protocol data unit) since these type of protocols doesn\u0026rsquo;t care about MAC addresses or stuff like that so it only takes the frame it needs, in this case a PDU.\nDNS The Domain Name System is really a name to get to an IP address, for example saidneder.tech is really an IP address behind it, as everything in the digital world, so we have DNS to remember more easily names of webpages, or phone numbers instead of remembering IP addresses everywhere.\nBefore the DNS server came around we had host files (see yours right now! in linux: cat /etc/hosts) and there you can create names of your preferred IP\u0026rsquo;s to visit.\nSo DNS resolves fully-qualifed domain names (FQDN) to IP addresses, and all internet connected hosts have a DNS server, a FQDN is a domain name that was verified and fully-qualifed with the requirement that is not taken and that is maximum 255 characters long with dots included.\nWorking with DNS To troubleshoot DNS problems you can:\nManually configure DNS and set up alternatives if one server goes down Use nslookup Hostname Is the name of the computer to be recognized in the LAN, and for windows this is useful with AD (Active Directory) and workgroups.\nIn windows:\nHomegroups (secure and automated organization, still a workgroup)[deprecated] Workgroups (simple, no security, no administration) AD (Windows server) Routers Routers connect the LAN to the ISP (Internet service provider) and it\u0026rsquo;s work is to connect you to the internet.\nTo configure most SOHO routers (Small Office/Home Office) that those types of routers include a switch, a router, and a WAP (wireless access point) they have a web interface, so in your browser you go to the specific IP of the router and from there you can configure them, most routers have in their back the IP address and their admin default password.\nSome routers need to be configured through the terminal with console ports, you connect yourself to the router with a specific cable and with a terminal you configure them.\nRouter configurations Configure both the WAN and LAN connections on your router. Avoid default settings for basic configurations (IP, SSID, passwords, etc) Don\u0026rsquo;t create too large of an DHCP pool DHCP reservations set aside IP addresses in the DHCP Pool Don\u0026rsquo;t enable remote managment Advanced router configuration Bandwidth is a thing to calculate in your LAN, since some devices require it more than others so the QoS is a toolset that meters how much bandwidth requires a certain IP, if more or less than others, or a certain MAC address, and is really up to you to take advantage of this option.\nUPnP (Universal plug and play) shows it every OS, so you can see your router in your options and configure it from your OS, in windows that\u0026rsquo;s called Link Layer Discovery Protocol, but there\u0026rsquo;s a much more powerful tool called SNMP (Simple network managment protocol) used by network administrators, is great!\nVLANs Virtual Local Area Network, takes a switch and digitally creates a virtual LAN, and that\u0026rsquo;s really useful if you have a lot of services going and you need them more organized but you don\u0026rsquo;t want to buy another switch, and by creating a VLAN you give an IP address to a switch, and a switch support that is called a managed switch, because switches are layer 2, so it just knows MAC addresses, so a switch that doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a IP address is an unmanaged switch, but a managed switch is more expensive.\nIf you have connected devices to a switch and they aren\u0026rsquo;t talking to each other you might have a problem with VLAN configuration by default.\nIn managed switches you can setup port security which is great because what it does is it remembers the MAC addresses of the connected devices in those specific ports, and if it changes, don\u0026rsquo;t enable the port at all, and send a notification about it, this is configured on the web interface of the managed switch.\nWorking with connections To check the status of your connection you can run netstat on your windows machine and it will show you network connections that you are having, what ports and protocol is using.\nWorking with workgroups With workgroups you can share SMB/Samba servers to share folders and so much more, by default you should leave the share to everyone and leave it on read/write but use NTFS permissions instead that are more powerful to configure your sharing, you must have an account on a remote system to access shared folders, security is an issue on workgroups if is used in an enterprise scale, the best way is to set up an active directory.\nWorking with Active Directory You need to create a domain controller that is a computer that runs windows server and it handles the domain accounts with SSO, is great by being security-focused with security policies that propagates on the whole domain, you can run login scripts and roaming profiles.\nNow you can share based on domain accounts, be careful of giving domain admin privileges since it has full power of the AD, so we use organizational units to tidy up the AD.\nWindows sharing with Mac and Linux Sharing across OSes is made the microsoft way with SMB (Server Message Block) or commonly known as Samba, you just need to give it a name and you can start sharing folders and files!\nThe net command Is a old tool but still rocking and it will give you information with the following flags\nnet view net share net use net user Firewall configuration To configure a firewall we need to follow the principle of least privileage, giving only the permissions that the user need to continue working, you can create access control list, whitelist/blacklist, you can set up a DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone) that is a LAN host exposed to the WAN.\nThere are two types of firewalls:\nStateless (block on fixed criteria) Statefull (block based on actions) Windows Firewall You can configure your windows defender firewall, so you set up profiles and block certain PID, ports and more, you can create exceptions on the three profiles (domain, public, private)\nPort forwarding You can setup ports that are available on the WAN by setting up port forwarding, you configure the ip, the port that the client connects and the port that it will forward to, we use nonstandard port numbers for security reasons and we can use DDNS to configure devices.\nNetwork Troubleshooting No connectivity\nAre you physically connected? Check your IP addressing if is made statically (IP conflict), use ping! Limited connectivity\nDHCP problem, watch for APIPA addresses, or you can have a rouge DHCP server where there\u0026rsquo;s information in the DHCP server that is conflicting. Intermittent connectivity\nProblem with cables, check your cables and check where they are because it can cause interference. Unavailable Resources\ncan you get to the system? (ping) if yes, check samba configuration. Slow transfer speed\nCheck your task manager to see what resources are eating up the bandwidth, where the QoS comes into place Chapter 20: Wireless networking The standard in the wireless world is the IEEE 802.11 that defines how all the wireless stuff talks.\nIf you have a WAP there\u0026rsquo;s different modes of running them and most of us use the infrastructure mode since it\u0026rsquo;s required to have a WAP to set it up, and to connect to it you will need a network card and there\u0026rsquo;s different ways to get it:\nPCIe expansion card USB adapter Built-in motherboard Laptops (The antenna is located on the monitor itself) Mobile devices (the entire case) The WAP will be configured to create a SSID (Service set identifier)\nWith Ad Hoc mode, is a way to create a LAN with wireless without a WAP, being one computer the WAP in this case.\nAntennas are really important in the wireless world and there\u0026rsquo;s different types of them:\nOnmi-directionals (like the ones on cars, just one straight up stick) Dipole (Two antennas in a same stick) Patch (Just in one side) Highly directional (like TV antennas, like directv) Yagi Parabolic Wi-fi standards The 802.11 standard is based on the ISM radios bands (Industrial, scientific and medical) and your WAP will use one or both of differents bands:\n2.4 Ghz 5 Ghz With a band being a range of radio frequencies, where the 2.4 band goes from 2.412 up to 2.4884 GHz of frequencies, and to make it simple they made channels, so each channel takes place on this range, being from 1 up to 14 but that differentiate if you are in Japan where is 14, if you are in Europe it will have only 13 and in the US only 11.\nWith the 5 GHz band: will go on from 5.150 up to 5.875 GHz, but the channels are weird coming from 36 up to 165, skipping a ton of numbers, check the standard, it just means that is really great.\nIEEE extensions Standards Speed Frequency 802.11a 54Mbps 5GHZ 802.11b 11Mbps 2.4GHz 802.11g 54Mbps 2.4GHz 802.11n 100mbps 2.4/5 GHz b, n and g are compatible since they run on the same band but not in a, except for n since it can run on both bands.\nMost 802.11n WAP have MIMO (Multiple in/multiple out) on by default that is that it can direction the radiation to the device.\nBut there\u0026rsquo;s other: 802.11ac, and it\u0026rsquo;s blazing fast! and it has MUMIMO (Multi user MIMO) it\u0026rsquo;s 2.4/5GHz for backwards compatibility, this standard is also called Wi-Fi 5, the thing is that Wi-Fi 5 is not compatible with Wi-Fi 4 NICS (Network cards) so that is the catch.\nBasic WAP setup For channel configuration you can see the how busy is the network with external applications (like wifiman made by ubiquity) and select your channel of preference, check that 1,6,11 are the preferred ones since they don\u0026rsquo;t overlap, and 5GHz just leave it to automatic.\nConfigure an SSID (the name of the wifi), and you can configure to broadcast it or to hide it, when hidden it will not show and you will need to enter it manually, this is a security feature according to compTIA (but not that secure tho)\nCheck the mode and set the channel width in auto as well as the channel itself, you can adjust the wattage where it can improve the radius where the signal covers, set it to your liking.\nConnecting to a wi-fi network If you have problems connecting with Wi-Fi:\nNIC is configured as DHCP client (bad password) Password can changed Set wireless NIC to static IP address Meshing The wireless mesh network (WMN) is really ad hoc but on steroids, were you setup a WAP, and then with Wi-Fi extenders configure it to extend the signal of one SSID with multiple devices, and is really but really easy to configure for SOHO environments.\nBeyond Wi-Fi There\u0026rsquo;s things like RFID (Radio frequency identification) is very important in cards to authenticate for doors in a building, or RFID stickers in a warehouse, RFID use tiny radios activated by the energy of the scanning device, and RFID for non nerds is NFC (Near Field Communication) and you see it on smartphones, credit cards, etc to connect, NFC is very low powered and you need to make them really close to each other to make them able to connect.\nBluetooth is like 802.11 but is a PAN connection protocol (Personal Area Network) where is point to point.\nWireless encryption WEP protection is awful AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is great, is still used today WPA (Wireless proctected access) is good and it used TKIP but then it was deprecated WPA2 is the king until today with WPA2/PSK (Pre Shared Key) and it uses AES WPS is easily crackable so don\u0026rsquo;t use it Enterprise wireless In an enterprise environment is a bit the same, just much bigger, and the way to handle wireless in the enterprise side is with WAPs that support PoE (power over ethernet) with a PoE switch of course, and you will be ready to go! just put those WAPs on the walls and connect them with ethernet and it will be turned on since it\u0026rsquo;s PoE, that is it!\nFor the authentication side you will need to use RADIUS, or TACACS+ boxes, that will implement the AAA standard (Authorization, Authentication, Accounting) that will ask an account (username and password) and you for the SSID creation you will need to use a ESSID (Extended SSID) so that every WAP uses the same SSID so that way you don\u0026rsquo;t need to sign in and out everytime.\nFor security you can setup isolation, that permits the users to only access the internet and not the LAN itself, it would not let them ping other devices or share folders for example.\nTroubleshooting Wi-Fi No connectivity\nThey may have changed the SSID, or password Low RF signal\nGet closer to the SSID and re arrange your antennas. Limited connectivity\nCheck if you have interference by your WAP, like microwaves. Intermittent connectivity\nLow RF signal, bandwidth busy, use QoS and upgrade your speeds. Chapter 21: The internet LAN = Local area network WAN = Wide area network MAN = Metropolitan area network PAN = Personal area network Internet tiers Tier 1 = Various different telecom companies work together to cover the country (peering agreements), where companies have their equipment is on a NOC (Network Operations Center) and NOCs are third party so there\u0026rsquo;s where the companies interconnect, these guys don\u0026rsquo;t pay for anything since they are the ones getting paid. Tier 2 = Not as powerful as a telecom but fair coverage area, not peering with tier 1 and they have to pay tier 1 as everyone, but have peering agreements here and there. Tier 3 = Big ISPs like AT\u0026amp;T, and they pay tier 1 \u0026amp; tier 2 to get their services, they win money by selling services to business and residential places. Dial-Up connections Or known as POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) is the old school telephone where you pay monthly for a cable to connect to a telephone, this is legacy but you can use it with a modem, being two RJ-11 ports, where one goes to your computer and other went to the modem, so that way you can use your telephone to send digital packets, but this is deprecated since it\u0026rsquo;s max speed is 56kbps.\nBroadband connections Wires, wireless, satellites you name it! This is about connections, let\u0026rsquo;s get them organized:\nDSL Digital Subscriber Line is the type of broadband that you used to get into the internet with a telephone cable with a modem, modern routers still supports this with PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol Over Ethernet)\nCable Cable uses DOCSIS (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification) where you can have TV signal and internet at the same time\nSatellite Is great! it has up to 25 mbps for download and upload speeds, but it has latency tho, but you can have it wherever you want!\n802.11 Some ISP companies will give you the option to just have your own antenna that receive signals from your ISP towers.\nFirewalls and servers Firewalls are just rules over ports, to enable them or accept connection over them with the incoming vs outgoing concept.\nFTP FTP (File transfer protocol) bases on the port 21 and works with repositories of data you want to transfer and you can access them through your web browser or a FTP client like filezilla is better, port triggering could be problem since there are two modes of FTP:\nActive Mode (outgoing port 21 and incoming port 20) Passive Mode (default, uses port 21 for incoming and outgoing) The thing is that in the client it has never started the communication on port 20 so every router will block it, so you need to enable the exception on your router settings.\nE-mail There are different ports for different e-mail protocols like:\nSimple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) = Port 25 Post Office Protocol (POP) = Port 110 Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) = Port 143 SMTP Is used on every e-mail protocol since it\u0026rsquo;s the base to sending and receiving mail, where it changes is in the last two protocols (IMAP \u0026amp; POP)\nPOP3 It will have all of your mail stored on your own computer.\nIMAP It will copy over the information from the server to your computer, the majority of the cases it will just display it.\nProxy Server Proxy servers are a MITM (Man in the middle) on your outgoing connections, so it can filter webpages that are restricted, or filter keywords that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be sent, and that way it increases security and privacy, and proxy servers can do caching, proxy servers are expensive though.\nVPN Virtual Private Networks, are a way to virtualize a connection between a device and your LAN, if you are far from home you can connect to your LAN by using VPNs and use your LAN services as you where home, so this is really powerful, you need to know the IP of the VPN server to connect as well as a VPN client.\nIoT The most common Internet of Things cases are in home automation, and they connect through 802.11, Zigbee or Z-Wave, IoT requires a hub to be controlled from, could the one that came with the product or an Arduino! Alexa, Google Home or Apple Siri are able to control IoT.\nTelnet and SSH Telnet was the way to get a reverse shell on your computer, to get a terminal from a computer remotely but the problem with telnet is that is unsecure because is not encrypted, so there is when SSH comes into place meaning \u0026lsquo;Secure SHell\u0026rsquo; and it runs on port 22.\nRemote Desktop Connections When connecting remotely with GUI in the windows world we use RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) running on 3389, this is the way to go if you want to connect to a windows server for example.\nFor linux and other OSes VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is the way to go, is pre-installed on mac and linux, but really VNC works everywhere even on windows to windows connections.\nThe World Wide Web If you want to connect to the WWW, using a web browser like firefox, brave, icecat or other you will be using HTTP and HTTPS ports (80 for http and 443 for https) and you need to look out for http since is really insecure because is not encrypted, so only go for https page.\nTroubleshooting internet connections Before anything check always your physical! your address and gateway also.\nCheck the internet connection with traceroute ping is just great, ping your gateway and a website to check if your DNS is working Chapter 22: Virtualization The VM (Virtual Machine) is just a machine with their own allocated memory, CPU, storage, etc from the host machine resources, being the host the real machine, this is not emulation since you are not trying to appear as some hardware that you don\u0026rsquo;t have, instead you are sharing your resources.\nYou need to activate the VT-X setting in the BIOS to enable virtualization, and to virtualize you need a hypervisor, there\u0026rsquo;s two types:\nType 1: Is like an OS itself (Proxmox, Esxi) Type 2: On top of your OS (VirtualBox, QEMU/KVM) Virtualization is isolated from the host, but you can configure it extensible.\nInstalling a VM This is really easy because I have background on this type of stuff, but if you anon are reading this and don\u0026rsquo;t have a clue well, install virtualbox, just google it, then go to linux mint\u0026rsquo;s website and download an ISO, which is a boot file to install linux mint, then create the VM in virtualbox with easy steps and you are ready to go!\nAdvanced configuration You can configure everything, like create more virtual hard drives, or create a shared folder between your real drive and the virtual drive, you can isolate the networking of the VM or bridge into your network as if it was a real machine in your LAN!\nCloud Computing The cloud is someone else computer where you don\u0026rsquo;t know where is it, and probably that someone is google (GCP) or microsoft (Azure) or Amazon (AWS) and you can control them, the great point is you have rapid elasticity, so you can duplicate your VM, or you can add more memory or CPU\u0026rsquo;s in a click of a button or increment the power of your VM on-demand, and the majority is paid on monthly bills, these are the business model:\nIaaS (infrastructure as a Service) IaaC (infrastructure as a Code) SaaS (Software as a Service) PaaS (Platform as a Service) Cloud Ownership They are different clouds:\nPrivate Clouds: Made by your organization and only for internal use Public Code: Businesses like AWS, Microsoft and GCP Hybrid cloud: A mix between the two, being one part private and another part open for business Community Cloud: This is setting up a cloud between different communities or businesses for members only. Cloud-Based Applications Cloud storage and synchronization we use everyday like google drive, one drive, icloud, this made shared folders really easy! and email as well as ton of things as well to put things off-side.\nStreaming applications are really famous of using the cloud, like netflix, or web based office, gaming, etc.\nChapter 23: Portable computing Functions keys are really important! So check the what functions you have and what can you do.\nLaptops have Keningston locks so you won\u0026rsquo;t take the laptop elsewhere, also they have docking stations but they aren\u0026rsquo;t that common anymore, there\u0026rsquo;s port replicators too that is a USB hub.\nLaptop Troubleshooting Be careful with the screws since they are really tiny, check your model\u0026rsquo;s manual online to see how to disassemble the specific model, and go for it with a goal in mind.\nIfixIt kit is really great and a anti-static mat as well!\nLaptop Hardware: CPU \u0026amp; Motherboard Best way to get to those places is by taking off the monitor, read the manufacture manual, and take pictures of your process to guide yourself.\nLaptop displays Use the right tools, remember that a monitor has a webcam, antennas, and more things built-in so check for that.\nPower managment Be careful with AC adapters, In the most cases buy from the manufacturer, if your battery die you just replace it, like any other battery.\nACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) enable us to suspend, sleep, hibernate and much more our laptops! This is where power managment was born 20 years ago.\nACPI has levels:\nLevel 0 = On but not in used Level 3 = Sleep Level 4 = Hibernation Chapter 24: Mobile Devices They are:\nSingle, sealed unit Runs specific mobile OS Wireless connectivity Connecting our mobile devices You can connect them wire or wireless, wired with USB micro B, or Type C or Lightning, to charge them or synchronize files, and wireless will be NFC, Bluetooth, Infrared, and wifi.\nVirtual reality Gaming is the real purpose for consumers, or useful purposes are medical, military, etc\u0026hellip; Remember the difference between VR and AR.\nMobile - Email Ports to remember:\nPOP encrypted port = 995 IMAP encrypted port = 993 SMTP encrypted port = 465 or 587 Synchronize Synchronize to the desktop Synchronize to car Synchronize to the cloud Mobile device security You need:\nA screen lock!!!! Face Recognition Multifactor auth Authenticator apps Locator apps Troubleshooting mobile security Signal drop/weak signal Turn the phone off since is concerning, run anti-malware or just reformat and backup, and change passwords everywhere Unintended wifi/bluetooth connections Remove known connections and if something is really wrong repeat step 1 Leaked personal data Result from a hack, you go cocoo bananas, reformat the phone, change passwords, change accounts, use a password manager. Troubleshooting mobile devices Non-responsive touch screen Reboot the phone if it goes away, remove apps and make a anti-malware check Dim display Turn on the brightness! disable auto brightness Cannot display to a external monitor Check you are on the same network, and check the right name of the device and compatibility No sound Disable bluetooth, reboot and turn the volume up No wireless connectivity Interference issues No bluetooth connectivity Check the device is discoverable, and is not paired already Apps not loading Clear the cache of the app, reinstall the app, reboot Slow performance You are running so many app Low battery Low brightness, turn off gps when not in use, when not using your phone turn it off. Overheating This is dangerous, so be careful, turn the phone off and put it in the fridge or a chill room. Frozen systems Problem with apps, really heavy load, delete the bad app System lock out Factory reset, is the best decision since it a bit wierd, just in case Chapter 26: Printers and multifunction devices Laser printers In laser printing you use a laser to hit a photosensitive drum to print into the paper with the laser, by following these steps:\nProcessing (Stores the print job on local memory) Charging (Negative charge) Exposing (Writing with laser) Developing (The toner prints the words) Transferring (Charges the paper) Fusing (Heat and pressure) Cleaning Laser printers are really easy to mantain, and if you have problem just replace the toner cartridge and then clean it, read the manual.\nInkjet printers Printing for the masses, you put the ink in the jet that is a separated box where you put the cartridges of ink, and if you have problems you can:\nClean the head (nozzles) Calibration Replace cartridges Impact Printers Impact printers are really old that used tractor feed paper, they aren\u0026rsquo;t common except on shipping businesses, and to maintain one you need to replace the ribbon and keep cleaning them.\nThermal printers Thermal printers are the ones that are used in stores for your receipt, and work with a special type of paper that is thermal sensitive so when you apply heat to the paper it changes colors, to maintain them you need to:\nClean the thermal Replace paper Clean debris Installing a local printer Connect a printer by one of two ways:\nUSB Serial You can install utitlies from the manufacturer to know what is happening with the printer.\nDevice drivers enable the OS to work with the printer Installing a local printer means connecting it to a workstation via USB or (uncommon) serial The print spooler enables multiple print jobs to queue Sharing a printer Is really trivial while using windows, is like a shared folder.\nSharing a local printer over the network requires sharing enabled and a share name Security options enable local control over the print spooler To connect to a shared printer, add a printer but select the shared printer rather than a local printer Installing a wireless and cloud printers A wired network printer has an Ethernet NIC and plugs in directly to the network It requires configuration to get on an 802.11 network Wireless print utilities can help troubleshoot any connectivity problems Cloud printing enables mobile devices to print to a printer associated with an online account such as a google account. Troubleshooting printers Unable to install a printer You don\u0026rsquo;t have permission, or not a printer to install No connectivity Are you physically connected to it? Network problem itself, reinstall it, rollback device driver Access denied No permissions, ask your administrator No image on printer display Check if is not sleeping, reset to default configuration or just replace the display Paper jam Replace pickup rollers Low memory errors Buy more ram, or reduce the resolution. Error Codes Look up for the error code to solve the problem. Garbled characters on paper Corrupted drivers Vertical lines on page Laser printers, replace the photosensitive drum Color prints in the wrong print color Replace color cartridge Printing blank pages Check each tech of printers to check what is wrong to replace since it means that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work. Streaks Inkjet issues, go to maintenance mode and clean it up. Faded prints Ribbon running out, low on toner, replace the toner cartridge. Ghost images Replace the toner Toner not fused to printer Replace the fuser Creased paper Put the printer in maintenance mode and clean it. 3D Printing You can use blender or cura to make 3D designs, and every 3D printer needs thermal plastic filament that is the plastic that will melt and dry really fast.\nChapter 27: Securing computers Threats Be on the look out for MiTM, DDOS, DOS, Spoofing by checking system files, logs, and more.\nPhysical security This is really important, security guards, locks, biometric locks, badge readers, smart readers doors, man traps, cable locks, privacy screen, server locks, usb locks, and much more is important.\nPasswords and authentication Strong passwords Looong passwords Password expiration Screensavers!! BIOS passwords!!! Passwords everywhere!! Multifactor auth Malware Virus Is malware that it\u0026rsquo;s job is to replicate everywhere\nWorm The first generation of malware that replicated on the network, emails, messages, etc\nTrojan Like the trojan horse, is a malware that appears as something legit but what it does it zombiefies your computer.\nRootKit Is malware that was stored on specific sectors of the storage to be sneaky, it isn\u0026rsquo;t anymore but is good to know, that is the compTIA way, but the real way is that a rootkit is a collection of malicious software designed to get access to a computer.\nRansomware Is a program that encrypts your files and if you want them back you need to pay the hacker in crypto, and the most cases it will not tell you the key to decrypt the files\nKeyloggers It registers your keystrokes.\nSpyware Is malware that spies on you but is really common like google, amazon, microsoft and more.\nSymptoms Pop-ups! check for pop-ups Browser redirections Security alerts Application crashes OS Update failure Spam Anti-malware Things to take note:\nNo such thing as anti-virus program Backup/restore End-user education Software firewalls Secure DNS 7 steps of dealing with malware:\nIdentify and research malware symptoms Quarantine infected systems Disable system restore (Windows) Remediate the infected systems Update the anti-malware and signatures Scan and use removal techniques (safe mode) Schedule scans and run updates Enable system restore and create a restore point (delete the old points) Educate the end-users Social engineering Be careful of:\nPhising Spear Phising Tailgating Shoulder surfing dumpster diving Licensing Everyone have deal with the EULA and proprietary software, like microsoft, or games with DRM to protect copyright, there\u0026rsquo;s difference between personal license and enterprise license, where it changes the way to use the product, but what if I can show you the way of FOSS, the free and open source software world where there\u0026rsquo;s no spyware and everyone is happy, that is thanks to the GNU public license, (GPL) and richard stallman, and with servers is complicated the pre-processor way to license windows since in servers you can pay up to more than 2 licenses of windows server for the same machine! so use linux.\nIncident response An incident is a problem that happens in the office that needs documentation and a special procedure, could be infected computers, a hacked router and so much more.\nKnow your responsibility Identify the problem Report through proper channels Data/Device preservation Use of documentation Document changes Keep chain of custody Tracking evidence Document process Environmental controls Make sure you are compliance to your government regulations MSDS (Material safe data sheet) to know how to handle devices Temperature and humidity levels, make it very cold and dry! Battery backup and get a ups Clean dust and debris (consider enclosures and compressed air) Dealing with threats Patch your system! Run anti-malware Run a firewall The intrusion detection system (IDS) is a software or could be a box that detects threats and notify the agents about it, but is deprecated because of the intrusion preventiton system (IPS) that replaced it, the difference between IDS and IPS is that the IDS notifies but the IPS notifies and tries to kill the threat by closing ports or blacklisting domains, these types of equipment is expensive tho.\nBut specially for smaller business there\u0026rsquo;s UTM\u0026rsquo;s (Unified Threat Managment) that is a service or a box that will combine a firewall, anti-malware and/or intrusion protection, and are available on the cloud.\nChapter 28: Operational procedures Documents you need to know Network topology diagrams Logical diagrams Physical diagrams Articles on the web (Documentation) Regulatory and compliance policy Laws Standards Best practices Traditions Common sense Policies Acceptable use policies (AUP) Password policies Inventory managment (Asset tags) Data you need to know Personal identifiable information (PII)[SSN, addresses, phone number, etc] Personal health information (PHI)[Blood type, vaccines, etc] EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)[cookies on website] Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)[how to control payment data] Change managment Is the organized, smart, careful system to make changes in the enterprise level and keeps them from losing money, or personel and such.\nChange board Documented business practices Purpose of the change Scope of the change Risk analysis Plan for the change End user acceptance Backout plan Document the changes (lessons learned) The zen of backup Backup and recovery:\nMobile devices Backing up on the cloud Windows and mac Backup and restore in control panel (file based vs image based) Backup testing Account recovery options Recycling and data destruction You can recycle:\nLi-lithion batteries CRT Monitors You can sell:\nCellphone and tablets If you want to destroy your data your put 5 holes on it and you are good to go! or run drive-wiping software if you want to reuse the drive.\nGood luck!

Arch Linux: sudo pacman -S nodejs Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install nodejs Redhat/Fedora: sudo dnf install nodejs npm (Already a Node JS dependency) git (Already installed on Linux) And some knowledge on javascript!\nGuide yourself with the official discord.js docs!\nBefore we begin We need to clone this repo with this command:\n1 git clone https://github.com/crazyc4t/PatrickStar.git And then to install the discord js library with a simple npm command!\n1 npm install discord.js create a new application in the developer portal of discord, over here!, once you go there create a new app and invite it to your server!\nAfter that, open the project folder in your favourite text editor and let\u0026rsquo;s start!\nLogging into discord Now in your folder project where you have your bot.js file, and create a config.json that is where we are going to store sensitive data so we can ignore it in a .gitignore file.\nThen in your config.json should look something like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 { \u0026#34;prefix\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;X\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;token\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;X\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;channelid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;X\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;guildid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;X\u0026#34; } What you are going to store:\nPrefix = That is the initial character to know that the message is for your block Token = Is your bot discord token, you can copy it from the developer portal ChannelID = Is the channel where your bot is going to reply (usually the spam channel from every server) you can find it activating the developer settings in discord\u0026rsquo;s settings and then right-clicking the channel. GuildID = Is the server ID Now we will start with the javascript Code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 // require the discord.js and cron module const Discord = require(\u0026#34;discord.js\u0026#34;); const cron = require(\u0026#34;cron\u0026#34;); // create a new Discord client const client = new Discord.Client(); // remote config file where my data is stored const { prefix, token, channelid, guildid } = require(\u0026#34;./config.json\u0026#34;); // When client is ready, run this: // This will only run one time after logging in client.once(\u0026#34;ready\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { console.log(`Online as ${client.user.tag}`); client.user.setActivity(\u0026#34;9help\u0026#34;); const kalamardo = client.guilds.cache.get(guildid); const channel = kalamardo.channels.cache.get(channelid); First we start by declaring the variables of the modules we are going to need, then we create the discord client with the variable of client and that is what we are going to use to refer to discord.\nThen we create the variables from the config.json to use them in the javascript file. The client.once is a discord.js function that is going to execute something just once when the bot is once ready, as in this bot we use it to tell us that is running with the client.user.tag that is the name of our bot, and we declare the variables of the channel where we want to send the messages.\nSetting up Cron Cron is a npm library that allows us to run something on scheadule, we will use it to notify us everytime we have class!\ndocs to install it we need to execute:\nnpm install cron\nNow we are going to create every cron job to run when the bot once log in:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 const notificationclass = `You have class! GO NOW ${idukay}`; const classbreak = \u0026#34;You have a break right now, patience and be calm, enjoy!\u0026#34;; // send a message if it is the time specified. let classnotification1 = new cron.CronJob(\u0026#34;00 00 13 * * 1-5\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { channel.send(notificationclass); }); let classnotification2 = new cron.CronJob(\u0026#34;00 35 13 * * 1-5\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { channel.send(notificationclass); }); let classnotification3 = new cron.CronJob(\u0026#34;00 10 14 * * 1-5\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { channel.send(notificationclass); }); let classnotification4 = new cron.CronJob(\u0026#34;00 45 14 * * 1-5\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { channel.send(classbreak); }); let classnotification5 = new cron.CronJob(\u0026#34;00 00 15 * * 1-5\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { channel.send(notificationclass); }); let classnotification6 = new cron.CronJob(\u0026#34;00 35 15 * * 1-5\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { channel.send(notificationclass); }); let classnotification7 = new cron.CronJob(\u0026#34;00 10 16 * * 1-5\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { channel.send(notificationclass); }); let classnotification8 = new cron.CronJob(\u0026#34;00 45 16 * * 1-5\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { channel.send(classbreak); }); let classnotification9 = new cron.CronJob(\u0026#34;00 00 17 * * 1-5\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { channel.send(notificationclass); }); let classnotification10 = new cron.CronJob(\u0026#34;00 35 17 * * 1-5\u0026#34;, () =\u0026gt; { channel.send( `You have ended your classes for today! enjoy the rest of your day` ); }); // When you want to start it, use: classnotification1.start(); classnotification2.start(); classnotification3.start(); classnotification4.start(); classnotification5.start(); classnotification6.start(); classnotification7.start(); classnotification8.start(); classnotification9.start(); classnotification10.start(); }); // login to Discord with token client.login(token); As you see the cronjob format of time is:\nSeconds: 0-59 Minutes: 0-59 Hours: 0-23 Day of Month: 1-31 Months: 0-11 (Jan-Dec) Day of Week: 0-6 (Sun-Sat) So right now is where you want to edit to your school scheadule and your own messages! Try it to be useful (like the zoom link of the class for example) so it can save you some time! After that, we login to discord with the client.login(token); function.\nCreate reply comments 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 client.on(\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;, (message) =\u0026gt; { if (message.content === `${prefix}help`) { // reply in the same channel from it was sent message.channel.send(help()); // you concatenate messages with the else if block } else if (message.content === `${prefix}calendar`) { message.channel.send(`There you go! ${calendar}`); } else if (message.content === `${prefix}idukay`) { message.channel.send(`Voila! ${idukay}`); } else if (message.content === `${prefix}mail`) { message.channel.send(`Sent! ${gmail}`); } else if (message.content === `${prefix}day`) { message.channel.send(`Today\u0026#39;s scheadule: ${days[today - 1]}`); } else if (message.content === `${prefix}info`) { message.channel.send( `This was made by Said Neder\\nGithub: ${github}\\nDiscord: ${discordid}` ); } }); First we use the client.on() function to listen to new messages to do something about it, which in this case is to reply to the messages.\nAnd then we use a big if/else block to control the flow of the program, there is where we decide the messages that we are going to listen, to reply them.\nFinally running the bot! And to see your final project use this commnad: node bot.js Since this runs in the back end, and we use node for that, and enjoy your new bot!\nBut it will only run if you are running the task, if you want to have it live 24/7 we have a extra step!\nSetting up the bot live on heroku! (optional) We will go straight to the chase my boi!\nFirst we need to create in our file a git repo, we do that with:\ngit init\nThen, we create a Procfile inside of our folder project with this text:\n1 worker: npm start And that means that the heroku server is going to execute the code in a form of a worker, not as a webpage.\nAnd now we add everything to git:\ngit add .\nAnd then we commit the files added:\ngit commit -m \u0026quot;deployment\u0026quot;\nNow we need to create a heroku account and create a new app over here!\nAfter that we download the heroku cli in our system, when that is done we login into the cli with the command\nheroku login And after that we just push it to heroku!\ngit push heroku main\nWhen that is done we go into the dashboard \u0026gt; resources and deactivate the web dyno by just clicking edit and switching off the slide, and now we turn on the worker that should appear, now it should be left like this\nAnd after that you are done! Hope that you enjoyed the guide!\n","date":"2022-02-11T11:19:06-05:00","image":"https://saidneder.tech/images/botdemo.gif","permalink":"https://saidneder.tech/blog/discordbot/","title":"How to write your own discord bot!"},{"content":"Intro This post is going to help you learn \\(\\LaTeX\\) and convert you into a intellectual and scientific professional and by far superior with anyone that shares their report made in word!\nBut before anything\u0026hellip;\nWhat is all this \\(\\TeX\\) thingy? In summary \\(\\LaTeX\\) is the form of creating a document with the highest quality of typesetting possible, being made with commands you will have to compile it each time to see the result so \\(\\LaTeX\\) isn\u0026rsquo;t a WYSIWYG(what you see is what you get) editor, but don\u0026rsquo;t worry! \\(\\LaTeX\\) is so awesome now that a quick CTRL+S will compile your result and let you see how you are going on time! so no worries there. The story goes back to 1977 when Donald Knuth understood the need for a high quality typesetting program, and \\(\\LaTeX\\) being still used today shows that is the best tool for it\u0026rsquo;s purpose, although many useful additions have been made and \\(\\LaTeX\\) has evolutionated since then.\nWhat is \\(\\TeX\\)? The original system made by Donald Knuth was called \\(\\TeX\\), what \\(\\TeX\\) do is to take a document in plain text and convert it to a beutifully typeset document with the highest quality possible, with a lot of in-built commands available for writing beutiful math equations, writing with the right fonts specific words and so on, but \\(\\TeX\\) was still quite basic, until \\(\\LaTeX\\) came by\u0026hellip;\n\\(\\LaTeX\\) The purpose of Leslie Lamport, the creator of \\(\\LaTeX\\) in the 80\u0026rsquo;s was to provide a higher level language for everyone to work on, since creating a document in \\(\\TeX\\) was in fact a bit complicated for doing simple things, making \\(\\LaTeX\\) a \\(\\TeX\\) but more friendly and easier to use, creating a package system that made the community to grow huge, being available thousands of packages to typeset whatever you want, code, images, you name it since \\(\\LaTeX\\) was document classes that let you typeset books, lab reports, articles, letters, math-focused documents, awesome presentations, PhD thesis, you name it, \\(\\LaTeX\\) got you covered with the highest quality available.\npdf\\(\\TeX\\) \u0026amp; pdf\\(\\LaTeX\\) The original \\(\\TeX\\) converted the .\\(\\TeX\\) files into a .dvi (DeVice Independent format) later on pdf\\(\\TeX\\) being created by Hàn Thế Thành for his PhD thesis which converted .\\(\\TeX\\) to .pdf being a great upgrade since pdf allowed things like hyperlinks, metadata, modern image formats, etc\u0026hellip;\nWhy learn \\(\\LaTeX\\)? Because \\(\\LaTeX\\) is used all over the world! apart of creating beutifully typeset documents, it allows users to tacke complicated things like inputting math, code, bibliography, table of contents, and so much more with a breeze, and with the huge amount of open source packages for \\(\\LaTeX\\) the possibilities are endless, and one of the most important reasons is that is easy and highly customizable since it separates the content from the style of the document, so you can style your document without ever needing to touch the content! and you can create your own style for the whole document very easily, that enables that creators share \\(\\LaTeX\\) templates, being pre-made layouts serving a specific purpose, like a CV/resume or a template for a math book, or just your english homework of school, you name it, there is a template that can help you!\nInstalling \\(\\LaTeX\\) This could be a bit complex since \\(\\LaTeX\\) comes with a lot of built-in packages but don\u0026rsquo;t worry! am going to explain step by step so it will be a breeze!\nDisclamer! At this day and age is not longer necessary to install \\(\\LaTeX\\), although recommended, you can use a online web editor like overleaf and you will be ready to rock! no caveats involved.\n\\(\\LaTeX\\) for Linux This is pretty straight forward, just install the texlive package for your distro! There are a lot of packages for \\(\\LaTeX\\) so they are grouped into size of the package (minimal, basic, small, medium, full) Like so:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ======================= Name Matched: texlive-scheme ======================== texlive-scheme-basic.noarch : basic scheme (plain and latex) texlive-scheme-context.noarch : ConTeXt scheme texlive-scheme-full.noarch : full scheme (everything) texlive-scheme-gust.noarch : GUST TeX Live scheme texlive-scheme-medium.noarch : medium scheme (small + more packages and : languages) texlive-scheme-minimal.noarch : minimal scheme (plain only) texlive-scheme-small.noarch : small scheme (basic + xetex, metapost, a few : languages) texlive-scheme-tetex.noarch : teTeX scheme (more than medium, but nowhere : near full) The best package for beginners is the medium one, I use it myself! And also you can install a \\(\\LaTeX\\) editor, my personal favourite is Kile is the best editor out there really, but it\u0026rsquo;s from KDE, so you will need QT/KDE libraries so could be a bit heavy but if you are using GTK (gnome, cinnamon, xfce) I would recommend gummi or gnome-\\(\\LaTeX\\) but is descontinued, so if you are using gnome 40-41 better go with gummi, although if you read my other post about vim you can use the vim\\(\\LaTeX\\) plugin and a document viewer like okular or evince, if you want to explore another alternatives to a \\(\\LaTeX\\) IDE you can read here\nFedora/RHEL\n1 sudo dnf in texlive-scheme-medium Debian/Ubuntu\n1 sudo apt in texlive-latex-extra Arch BTW\n1 sudo pacman -S texlive-most \\(\\LaTeX\\) for Windows Really straight forward with the MiKTeX distribution of \\(\\LaTeX\\)!\n\\(\\LaTeX\\) for Mac The same applies with the MacTeX distribution of \\(\\LaTeX\\)!\n\\(\\LaTeX\\)ing Let\u0026rsquo;s start \\(\\LaTeX\\)ing baby!\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 % This is a comment % We specify what type of document we are creating in this case, an article \\documentclass[a4paper,10pt]{article} % UTF-8 encoding \\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % We start the document \\begin{document} % We use \\LaTeX so it can look cool % we specify a \\ after the \\LaTeX function since it eats an space Isn\u0026#39;t that hard to \\LaTeX \\ as I thought! \\end{document} % Here the document ends, anything below this command will not be considered.

I wish you the best for this year and time to rock on and create and achieve what you most want! I welcome you to this new year with this new blog post! I haven\u0026rsquo;t write an advice post in a while so let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nWhat is overthinking? Overthinking is just the action to before doing something you think a lot of that action so you can excuse yourself to not do it, If you need to training, but before showering and getting ready you are already thinking \u0026ldquo;My pinky toe hurts a bit I should stay\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; just getting excuses on top of your head to not do something that you don\u0026rsquo;t feel like doing.\nHow can it ruin your mindset? Your mindset being the way you think, to make an action and make it your way, the way you tackle things and situations in life, how do you feel if something happens, this ruins your mindset completly in the way that if something bad happens, for example you are trying to leave tobacco and you smoke a cigarette and relapse, how do you feel about it? The first thought is regret, and then the following thought is a strategy to leave it, but then you overthink it, while you think about it you are seeing the difficulty of it, the struggle you will have to pass, and that makes you thing to go out with a \u0026ldquo;blast\u0026rdquo; and so you light up another cigarette and say \u0026ldquo;this one is for good, my goodbye one\u0026rdquo; and cycles repeats.\nBut why? Because you didn\u0026rsquo;t took action when you supposed to, the second thought being the strategy to leave tobacco, should be as easy as saying \u0026ldquo;I will not smoke tobacco anymore\u0026rdquo; and go on with your day, but instead you thought about what if, what am going to do if, and so on and so forth that you think that is too hard and just to not feel bad you light up another cigarette\u0026hellip;\nHow can we stop overthinking? Is not easy, is a fight am going through a lot right now, but I can share some tips:\nDevelop a \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; theory That being that every opportunity that you have to do something different, or a thought that came to your mind to cook something or just something you wanna do, just say \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo;, and do it right away, don\u0026rsquo;t think about tasks that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to do, everytime you want to do something just say yes.\nMeditate This is pretty self-explanatory, try to take some time of your day to meditate, could be in the shower, after having some exercise, as you wish, but take some time to think how you are going through the day, what you need to improve and essentially to take it with calm and with wisedom.\nRead a book This certainly will teach you to not think twice, since reading a book is boring and difficult and you always put excuses for it, just grab it and read 5 pages, and that way you will develop an habit to just do what you need and want to do.\nDevelop the right mindset Be positive, notice your progress, be happy about it, listen to good music and enjoy the life that you have since there could be no tomorrow so enjoy it as it fullest, and don\u0026rsquo;t let a little slip-up ruin your whole day, get the right mindset, know your goals, be honest with yourself and know what are you doing great and what you are not, make a plan and improve.\nClean your room everyday Everyday clean your room, your desk, mop the floor, tidy everything up, organize your things and develop the habit to do it every morning, it will make you feel good to go on with your other tasks.\nOutro This are my 2 cents, I write this advices to myself but I know someone could need this and that\u0026rsquo;s why I share them with you, if you know something and you don\u0026rsquo;t share it, that\u0026rsquo;s just being selfish right? hope you liked this post and I\u0026rsquo;ll keep you updated!\n","date":"2022-01-10T01:56:57-05:00","image":"https://saidneder.tech/images/chill-images/ba%C3%B1os.jpeg","permalink":"https://saidneder.tech/blog/dontoverthink/","title":"How can overthinking ruin your mindset"},{"content":"Intro This is a vim-neovim tutorial, is a highly-configurable text editor that you can make it as you wish, and the way to use it is only with the keyboard and keybindings and learning it will improve your productivity at a whole other level, and it is included in every UNIX system and Mac OS, so if you configure servers remotely or work a lot in the terminal is really important to use vim, and you can add plugins and make a lot of cool stuff with it!\n1.0 Installing vim The first step into the rabbit hole, here it goes!\nDebian/Ubuntu sudo apt in vim\nFedora/RHEL sudo dnf in vim\nArch Linux sudo pacman -S vim\n1.1 Vim modes Vim has three modes and each one of the three you can escape them with ESC:\nNormal mode: You use it to navegate in the editor, you should be in this mode the most of the time. Insert mode: In this mode you can type text into the file, type I to enter insert mode. Visual mode: In this mode you can select large chunks of text, to copy, paste, cut, etc\u0026hellip; 1.2 Quitting vim There are different ways of quitting vim, but these are the most important:\n:q! = Quit and don\u0026rsquo;t save changes :q = Quit :wq= Write and quit :x = Exits the file, if the file has changes it will save them. 1.3 Useful shortcuts to use To quickly go to the initial character of the line = 0 To go to the first line of the document = gg To go to the last line of the document = G (shift+g) To go to a particular line of the document = 10G (10 is the number of the line you want to go) To go to the most near parenthesis use = % To execute a command inside vim = :!neofetch Vim can help you if you don\u0026rsquo;t remember a command! just use ctrl+d when writing a command, for example you want to write and quit but don\u0026rsquo;t remember how, just press the inital letter and then ctrl+d the :w 1.4 Deleting, undoing and redoing! To delete the character that the cursor is selecting = x if you want to delete more than one character you can by doing so = 4x (Knowing that the 4 is the quantity of characters you want to be deleted) To undo what you did use = u The same principal tackles undo with multiple times = 3u To redo, just use = ctrl+r To delete word by word use = dw To delete line by line use = dd To delete backawards word use = db To delete from the cursor until the end of the line use = D 1.5 Navigating more in-depth To navigate word by word use = w (ends of the beginning of each word) If we want to navigate word by word ending on the last character of the word use = e Mix it up! navigate between quantity of words = 3w Go backawards = b Navigate by visual lines! Vim is made to navigate (h,j,k,l) in logical lines, where it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to help when inserting, but if you want to navigate for reading use = gj (gj being visual down) Using w, b and e more in-depth: when navigating with this keys, the commas, parenthesis, etc, are counted as a word, but if we don\u0026rsquo;t want that just capitalize it! = W B E Forwarding to navigate to a specific character, for example move the cursor where a letter t is = f example = ft Forwarding in reverse! = F Forwarding until, forward until you find a certain character, landing the cursor before that character = t Forwarding until in reverse = T Inserting without caring about blank characters, inserting to the first non-blank character = shift+i Navigating between blocks of text, being next blank line use = } Navigating between blocks of text, being the previous blank line use = { 1.6 Replacing, appending and changing You mistyped something? Not to worry with the replace function! it replaces the character where the cursor is and then press it replacement = r If you want to change something, you can with the change function, where it changes the character before the cursor, for example let\u0026rsquo;s change a word, remember to exit out of insert mode, let\u0026rsquo;s use = ce Let\u0026rsquo;s change a entire line! use = C Let\u0026rsquo;s append to a line, since inserting is always before the cursor, append to insert after the cursor = a Append to the last character of the line = shift+a To delete a character and start in insert mode use = s To delete a entire line and start in insert mode use = S To insert on the line below use = o To insert on the line above being on the line that you are use = O 1.7 Yanking and putting! Yanking is copying in vim, so for example let\u0026rsquo;s yank a word! = yw What if you want to delete something and put in on other line? = p (For example, you delete a line dd and put it three lines below p) Yank from the cursor till the end of the line with = Y Remember that cutting in vim is just deleting and putting it 1.8 Searching in your document Press / and then the word you want to search! If you have multiple instances of that word, you can use n to go next or N to go backawards When searching to go back to where you started, and if pressed again to the beginning of the file, use = ctrl+o If I want to go forward where I was use = ctrl+i Replace your finding! press : and then s/finding/replacement/g following the formula! Replacing in the entire document, formula = %s/finding/replacement/g Replacing in the entire document with a yes/no prompt = %s/oldstring/newstring/gc Replacing each instance between lines = 3,9s/oldstring/newstring/g Reminder: Remember to mix it up! You can mix numbers with hotkeys, for example if you want to delete 10 lines you aren\u0026rsquo;t going to press dd 10 times, just multiply it! 10dd and so on and so forth with the others! Mix it up!\nOutro This is for now! these are the essential vim hotkeys and commands to survive and to start into the rabbit hole, expect more of vim in my blog thank you for reading!\n","date":"2022-01-09T22:00:04-05:00","image":"https://saidneder.tech/images/neovim.png","permalink":"https://saidneder.tech/blog/vimforeveryone/","title":"Vim for everyone!"},{"content":"Intro This is a special blogpost since this is the guide to switch from windows to linux for new users, and the way to free them of propietary software and enjoy their freedom with free software, the software you should run!\nWe are going to divide this guide in steps:\nIntro For the FAQ\u0026rsquo;s I made a blogpost that covers this questions:\nWhat is Linux?\nWhat is GNU?\nWhat is GNU/Linux?\nWhat are distros?\nWhy should I care?\nShould I switch?\nIt does cover this questions in a bit of technical way tho, but check it out if you want to learn more!\nThe \u0026ldquo;difficult\u0026rdquo; part of linux is unlearning windows, since here in linux we are different in this aspects:\nPrivacy and security\nUpdating and installing software\nPhilosophy\nBut don\u0026rsquo;t worry! Am here to explain to you every step of the way and to enjoy once and for all your free computer, free as in freedom.\nAm going to cover the topics above broadly\u0026hellip;\nPrivacy and security The only privacy setting you need to turn on/off is location for the weather, meaning that no sending \u0026ldquo;anonymous\u0026rdquo; data to big companies or similar cases, and linux being based as a unix-like operating system it works with multi-users, being always two users:\nRoot\nbeing root is being god in other words, you can do anything and everything, so this is the user we are not going to use. User (you)\nThis is where you come in place, all of your configurations and files are stored on your \u0026ldquo;home\u0026rdquo; folder, and if something happens it will only run as your user, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t have any type of permission at the OS level, so no worries, and viruses are not developed for linux since is a OS that the minority uses, now when we need for root perrmissions temporarly, we ask root if we can borrow them for a bit using a command named \u0026ldquo;sudo\u0026rdquo; (super user do) so we should never log in as root only if you know what you are doing. Installing software This and the security, for me are the selling points for linux, installing software on linux is really easy, no more of going to a website to download a .exe just to figure out it was a virus\u0026hellip; Installing software on linux is straight-forward, the software you want is on a repository or known as \u0026ldquo;repos\u0026rdquo; (server) and what you do is to install directly from that official server, being this simplified, you just go to an app store that is a pre-installed program and just download your software and you are ready to go! you will get updates in the same app store, so not to worry about it.\nPhilosophy I already tackled a bit of this topic on another blogpost but talking this broadly, is about the philosophy of community, since linux is a community driven by free and open-source software, that users control it and doesn\u0026rsquo;t control them, about being helpful, asking questions when you don\u0026rsquo;t understand something, searching your question on the web, being curious, and to support and say free software, since this is the software we need to fight for our freedom.\nSteps to follow: Compatibilty\nFlashing\nInstalling\nFreedom!\nStep 0: Compatibility. This is a easy step, this step is to check the software we use if there is a linux version or alternative, since Adobe software or Microsoft Office is not available for linux, but there are alternatives, for example:\nOffice Suite = Libre office\nPhoto editor = GIMP\nVector Graphics = Inkscape\nVideo Editor = Kdenlive\nDrawing software = Krita\nDJ software = Mixxx\n3D Modeling = Blender\nCAD Software = FreeCAD\nBrowsers, spotify, discord, or others are all on linux, so no worries by that side!\nAnd gaming is great too! Steam being on all repos and the majority of games run with the proton compatibility layer.\nAnd in this step we need to back up all of our files because once we install linux our files are going to be DELETED so please take a lot of caution, back up all of your important files.\nStep 1: Flashing Flashing, what is that? let me explain\u0026hellip; To install Linux the only requirement we need to have besides our computer is a flash drive (or known as a pen drive), 4gb of space is perfect to (as the word says) flash linux, but before getting to that step we need to choose our distro.\nChoosing our distro A distro is a operating system based on GNU/Linux, and there are a ton of distros, but we are going to choose just one, and a good one of course.\nSince this is a beginner guide, we are going to choose beginner friendly distros, and the three options that I recommend are:\nLinux Mint\nElementary OS\nPop!_OS\nThis three distros are free as in freedom but free as in free beer too! , but what are the differences are which one should you choose? well, depends who you are:\nPop!_OS OS created by system 76 an American computer company that desings their computers with freedom and linux in mind, being this distro good for tech-savy people, gamers, coders, or curious people, specially if you have a nvidia card, just go with this option.\nLinux Mint OS made for users that wants their computer to just werk, equiped with software, desinged with functionality in mind with a user interface easy to use, really good with old and low-end hardware, similar to windows 7, fast, secure and it just works.\nElementary OS OS made for creative users, with a beutiful desktop enviroment similar to Mac OS, being feature-rich like multitasking view, picture in picture, and a lot more, being a clean and polished distro with a beutiful desktop.\nWhen you have made your mind, time to download the .iso! that is the OS itself, in a file, so go to the webpage of the distro you have chosen (Up in the blog there are the links, below choosing our distro) and download the file!\nIs straight-foward but a note:\nFor mint users: when you go to the download page there are three options: xfce, mate, and cinnamon, now:\nXfce = For really old or low-end hardware, user interface isn\u0026rsquo;t the prettiest.\nMate = For old hardware, stability and traditional feeling, not a lot of features.\nCinnamon = Active development, modern, good look and feel, recommended for 2 GB of ram and up. (go with this one)\nFor elementary OS users: At the front of the screen it says \u0026ldquo;purchase elementary OS\u0026rdquo;, and above it says \u0026ldquo;pay what you can\u0026rdquo; I highly recommend paying for the OS, at least $5 bucks, but if that\u0026rsquo;s not the case for you, you can insert a digit in the \u0026ldquo;custom\u0026rdquo; box, and insert 0 and download it for free!\nFor Pop_OS! users: There are two versions,the nVidia one and the intel/amd one, download the one according to your hardware, this is pretty straight-foward too, if you don\u0026rsquo;t know what nVidia is, then just download the intel/amd one.\nFlashing our distro Download etcher on their website and install it, then time to plug your flash drive but WARNING everything in the flash drive WILL BE DELETED, so back up your files, now just follow the steps in screen, that is the first step to select the .iso that you downloaded, the second to select your flash drive and the third to flash, and should look like so:\nAfter this, we are READY!!!! this should be exciting!\nStep 2: Installing Before booting into linux, we need to make some changes in bios, now this could look scary but it really isn\u0026rsquo;t! (make sure your usb is connected)\nNow follow this steps and you will be fine:\nReboot your computer\nBefore your laptop starts up, press the ESC or DELETE key (top right and top left) to enter bios\nNow on BIOS, depending what computer you have you can use your mouse or just your keyboard, now navigate too BOOT section with the arrow keys, and deactive SECURE BOOT (blame microsoft) and then you will have a boot order, change the order being the flash drive the first priority.\nNow go the SAVE section and save settings and reboot.\nNow you should boot into linux!\nIf you made this successfully, congrats! you have made the hardest thing in this whole step!\nNow you are on the desktop of your chosen linux distro! (except elementary OS, follow the installer and choose \u0026ldquo;demo mode\u0026rdquo;)\nBeing for me the linux mint desktop!\nThis is the perfect moment to check everything out, remember it won\u0026rsquo;t be as fast since is running from a simple USB, but you can get an idea of what you are going to get, so check the desktop, your wifi, bluetooth, mouse, keyboard, everything, once you are happy about that everything works (and if it does not, search your error on the web, since this type of errors have easy fix) now is time to continue with the installer, just follow the on screen instructions and you will be fine!\nNote: If you have the option to install multimedia codecs, do it! is for managing audio and video files.\nNow here is a side-note, there\u0026rsquo;s something called \u0026ldquo;dual booting\u0026rdquo; that is having linux alongside windows, and when you boot your computer you will decide what operating system you want to use, and this could be great as it could be a little bit of a headache, I have dual booted before and my experience has been okay-ish, but other users have reported that when Windows updates have deleted their linux partition, or have deleted their boot entry (that has happen to me before and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t recover linux, but it was my fault in certain way) so you can have a dual boot, or just wipe out windows and have only linux (recommended way) but finally is your computer and you have the last word, if you decide to dual boot, your installer will give you the option and you will need to decide how much space you want to give each OS, so take that in mind since windows is bloated and heavy, so for me a clean install is the best option but is your computer after all.\nNow, along the installer you will have the option to encrypt your drive, please do it it will increase your security being the case that someone has access to your computer fisically they can\u0026rsquo;t do anything about it since the information is encrypted and your data protected, is a huge plus!\n(this is the case for linux mint, to encrypt your home folder)\nAfter all, we are golden! Welcome to Linux!\nStep 3: Freedom Now this is the final step, enjoy your freedom! now you are free to do whatever you want, so go explore! code a bit, learn the command line, install gimp and edit some pics, go crazy! But there\u0026rsquo;s some steps I would recommend to do before you go crazy!\nUpdate the system (you can do so by inserting this command into the terminal sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade) Install media codecs (you can do that by executing this command in the terminal: sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras) Those steps is to get everything updated and ready to rock! now go crazy!\nOutro Hoped that you liked this blogpost, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of heart on this specific post, so if you like my content you can share it with your friends or buy me a coffee down below!\nThis are resources that can help you!\nFor the whole process you can take this video to guide you made by Anthony Young from Linus tech tips!\nPop_OS!\n5 Things to do after installing Pop!_OS by TechHut Pop!_OS FULL beginners guide by Learn Linux TV Linux Mint\nFrom noob to power user with Linux Mint Cinnamon! By Derek Taylor Elementary OS\nElementary OS Review By Mental Outlaw (Ma boi kenny) (This video is not that updated but is good!) And that\u0026rsquo;s it for me!

Although this guide is more toward linux users but if you are here from windows you can follow along too!\nFish, the friendly interactive shell from the 90\u0026rsquo;s Fish is a smart and user-friendly shell for every unix-like OS, it offers:\nAutosuggestions Sane Scripting Tab completitions and syntax highlighting And a lot more! Overall, is the way to go, time to go fishing\nNeovim, Hyperextensible Vim-based text editor Neovim being a vim-based editor is not for everyone, since navigating vim is not the easiest task of all, but neovim what it does is to take vim (VI-iMproved, since vim is a fork from VI) and eliminates all the deprecated and legacy packages (30% less code base than vim), then improve it even more with plugins, extensions, and more!\nIs a beutiful text-editor, one of my favourites!\nNerd Fonts, the best fonts to code with! Nerd fonts are fonts designed for coding in mind, and it has icons as text that is the awesome part, since we are going to use those icons for customizing our terminal\nBat, the cat with wings! bat is cat but with super powers, with syntax highlighting and supports git integration, and it displays it\u0026rsquo;s text in a well readable format, once you go bat you never go back!\nInstall Alacritty, Fish, Bat and Neovim Ubuntu/Debian:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:aslatter/ppa \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-3\nThat is to add the personal package archives, that is a personal repository where you can download software from the owner of the software, being the latest version and overall better, in this case from alacritty and fish devs.\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install alacritty bat fish neovim -y\nThis will refresh the repo list and install it!\nFedora/RHEL: sudo dnf install alacritty bat fish neovim Easy isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\nArch (btw): sudo pacman -S alacritty bat fish neovim You already know.\nUninstalling Alacritty, Fish, Bat and Neovim\nThis is the case if you don\u0026rsquo;t like it\nUbuntu/Debian:\nFirst, remove the software: sudo apt remove --auto-remove alacritty fish bat neovim\nThen, the PPA\u0026rsquo;s sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:aslatter/ppa \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:fish-shell/release-3\nFedora/RHEL:\nsudo dnf remove fish alacritty bat neovim\nArch (btw):\nsudo pacman -R alacritty fish bat neovim\nInstalling nerd fonts! You can go to the official nerd fonts github and follow their installation guides or use a bash script I created for installing nerd fonts the easiest way!\nDownload the bash script\n1 wget https://github.com/DarthNeder/nerdy/releases/download/v1.0.0/nerdy \u0026amp;\u0026amp; bash nerdy -h This will download the script and run the help command so you can see the usage of the script\nInstall some fonts! Is just as easy to\n1 bash nerdy RobotoMono This means you are installing RobotoMono nerd font on your system! If you are not sure which one to install you can go to programming fonts and decide which one to install!\nAfter installing nerd fonts, neovim, fish and alacritty, time to configurate them!\nHacking alacritty First in your new terminal we are going to create the alacritty.yml file, this is the configuration file, and is going to be store in ~/.config/alacritty/.\nSo now this is what we are going to do:\n1 2 3 $ cd $ mkdir .config/alacritty $ nvim .config/alacritty/alacritty.yml (The first cd was for changing directories to your home folder)\nNow, before we get into the code, just for reference you can see this alacritty config to take for example, and the arch wiki since it has a nice page explaining about it.\nRunning fish as our default shell\n1 2 shell: program: /bin/fish This means everytime alacritty is going to open is running the fish shell.\nRemember the YAML Is the format used to configure alacritty, in key-value pairs.\nRunning nerd fonts as our default font\nFirst of all check the family name of your font by running this command:\n1 fc-list | grep Hack Being Hack replaced with your font\u0026rsquo;s name, once you know that time to create the font table like this:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 font: normal: family: RobotoMono Nerd Font style: Regular bold: family: RobotoMono Nerd Font style: Bold italic: family: RobotoMono Nerd Font style: Italic bold_italic: family: RobotoMono Nerd Font style: Bold Italic size: 9.0 Specifying the font family and the size of it, if you want, (I know you do) we can specify the padding of the prompt and the background opacity of it\n1 2 3 4 5 background_opacity: 0.75 window: padding: x: 4 y: 4 And we are done with alacritty and fish!\nNow we are going to install starship to beutify our prompt and plus is written on rust!, then there\u0026rsquo;s exa that is the new replacement for the ls command.\nInstalling starship and exa For starship:\nJust run the installer:\n1 2 bash sh -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://starship.rs/install.sh)\u0026#34; ## if you are in fish, if not just run without `bash` at the beginning and add this to the config.fish, that is located in ~/.config/fish/config.fish\n1 2 3 # ~/.config/fish/config.fish starship init fish | source Side note:\nIf you don\u0026rsquo;t like the \u0026ldquo;welcome to the fish shell!\u0026rdquo; greeting message, you can delete it by so:\nset -g fish_greeting\nwriting this in config.fish.\nMore docs\u0026hellip;\nFor exa:\nUbuntu/Debian: sudo apt install exa\nRHEL/Fedora: sudo dnf install exa\nArch Linux (btw): sudo pacman -S exa\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s it! now you have starship and exa in your terminal!\nNow replace cat and ls with aliases:\nIn config.fish:\n1 2 alias ls=\u0026#34;exa -la --icons\u0026#34; alias cat=\u0026#34;bat\u0026#34; Now last but not least final step\u0026hellip;\nTheming Alacritty First of all let\u0026rsquo;s install node.js that makes running javascript on the backend possible!\nUbuntu/Debian: sudo apt install nodejs\nRHEL/Fedora: sudo dnf install nodejs\nArch (Btw): sudo pacman -s nodejs\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s install alacritty themes!\n1 npm i -g alacritty-themes If you get npm errors, try to update npm: npm update\nNow the moment of truth!\nJust run the script! alacritty-themes\nand select the theme you like and enjoy!\n","date":"2021-11-14T19:55:31-05:00","permalink":"https://saidneder.tech/blog/niceterminal/","title":"How to customize your terminal!"},{"content":"Intro First of all, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the definition of the word comeback shall we?\nComeback: a return to a former higher rank, popularity, position, prosperity, etc.\nWith that being said, a comeback is when you are on the low side of your streak and you make the effort to get back where you deserve and were.\nThis is critical in life, you will have a lot of situations that will demotivate you, stop your momentum, your rhythm, and make you begin from scratch again, and it will be difficult, to not say painful, since from your growth zone you fell back to your comfort zone, and then is when you have to get up.\nYou first need to organize yourself and create a plan of attack, since this is a problem needed to be taken with aggression.\nPlan of attack First of all you should have a journal, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have one, don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it, (Tomorrow\u0026rsquo;s post will be how to journal and document your day to day so don\u0026rsquo;t forget!) but before we need to answer this:\nWhy a journal? Because in a journal you document what you do in your day to day, so if you feel something is not going as planned, or you feel like you are not better that yesterday, go and check what you did and your thoughts of that day and compare them with your thoughts of today or the day that wasn\u0026rsquo;t that good, and the next day try to mimic the same thoughts, and activities, to gain momentum, I know that is hard and that advice is a bit stupid \u0026ldquo;if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do something, just do it and that\u0026rsquo;s it\u0026rdquo;, but there is where the plan of attack comes into place, this is a war between you and yourself, so you have to know yourself where to attack, your weakest points, your good points, where you can get attacked, and how to defend yourself, you vs you.\nOrganization Organize your day wisely, because this is what will change the outcome, the first hour of your day is extremly important, you can\u0026rsquo;t screw this up, if you screw the first hour of your day, it will be really difficult to come back on top, so organize your day from the less stimulating activity to the most, from the less difficult to the hardest one, for example:\nWake up Take a shower Tidy up your room Document your journal (important) Breakfast Activities You see, i didn\u0026rsquo;t include your phone, or your tv, or your nintendo switch, since this activites are really stimulating, so if you make this stimulating activities will be really hard to accomplish a less stimulating activity, for example, you are not going to play videogames and then read a book, it will be extreamly boring and while you are reading you are thinking about playing again, so that\u0026rsquo;s why organization is extreamly important and the first hour of your day more yet, since this will define your confidence level and mood for the day, so be smart about it, do this step the night before, so when you wake up you know exactly what you need to do, that will make you different from everyone else.\nAttack After organizing your day it takes action to accomplish what have you promised to do, be realistic please, so that way you will not be dissapointed about yourself, action is key, just think the momentum and the rhythm you will level up if you accomplish this, don\u0026rsquo;t think much about it, just go and do it, but remember you are in a war, and in this moment is where the enemy will want to go full gas on his attacks, the attacks will be:\nDistractions (Phone, Videogames, Another activities) Overthinking (I can\u0026rsquo;t, Will start tomorrow) Lack of purpose (Activities due to accomplish lack purpose) False tiredness And you need to be ready to comeback this attacks with something that you know will work, and if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, make it work, that is what life is about isn\u0026rsquo;t? so be ready and mindful when this happens and prepare your counter attacks.\nCounter Attack Your counter attacks need to be ready before the attacks happens, a warrior doesn\u0026rsquo;t go to war without his sword, so your counter attacks need to be lock and loaded.\nThis are mine, and could help your but you know yourself best\nCold shower Prepare myself something to eat Go for a walk Talking to someone for a bit Sing a song These a powerful counter attacks that you can use, just make sure to be ready.\nCompleting the comeback You complete the comeback by meditating about all you have done, pray to give thanks that you have made it, document everything you made and be ready for tomorrow, and with time you will grab some high momentum and it will seem easy but beware, that is the time your enemy is with their guns lock and loaded and you have your guard down, Don\u0026rsquo;t let that happen and if it happens\u0026hellip;\nTRY AGAIN ","date":"2021-10-13T23:53:55-05:00","image":"https://saidneder.tech/images/chill-images/cuicocha.jpeg","permalink":"https://saidneder.tech/blog/comeback/","title":"How to comeback and win in life"},{"content":"Intro Am going to talk about one of my favourite things in the world, what lead me to where I am today, Linux, the open-source operating system created by the community!\nWhat is linux? You use Linux everyday, without even noticing, you are using linux right now!! since this webpage is hosted on github, and github is hosted on azure that is the cloud computing service that microsoft offers, that their servers are based on linux, you see the connection? Linux is everywhere! and you can\u0026rsquo;t escape it, linux is on your cars, roku devices, servers, super computers, android phones, smart devices, and we can go like this for hours, but answering the real question\nLinux is a operating system just like Windows and Mac OS\nBut is a bit different\u0026hellip;\nLinux itself ins\u0026rsquo;t a operating system, is a kernel, and what is a kernel you may ask, a kernel is the core of the operating system, the kernel function is to manage the hardware (CPU, RAM, physical devices, etc\u0026hellip;) to make it interact with your software, so for example: google chrome needs 2 GB of ram for all your tabs, so it interacts with the kernel so the kernel gives google your ram.\nThe kernel is the lowest level of the OS, meaning that is the most attached to hardware.\nSo, if linux is a kernel, how is an operating system? And that\u0026rsquo;s a great question, Linux was made by Linus Torvalds, who started linux as a \u0026ldquo;personal project\u0026rdquo; and made the source code open to the public so they can opine about it, but what it really made was that people wanted to work with him! and he said \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s a personal project, nothing big like GNU\u0026rdquo; (we will cover the GNU part later) and people wanted to contribute to his project with code! and a big group of people around the world that liked the project contributed with code, currently 5,000+ persons are contributing code to linux and the linux kernel has already 1,000.000 commits! and finally the linux kernel was created, here is where GNU comes into place.\nWhat is GNU? GNU is a Unix-like operating system. That means it is a collection of many programs: applications, libraries, developer tools, even games. The development of GNU, started in January 1984, is known as the GNU Project. Many of the programs in GNU are released under the auspices of the GNU Project; those we call GNU packages.\nFrom the official GNU\u0026rsquo;s webpage\nBut the summary is that GNU (GNU not Unix) is a Unix-like operating system (Mac OS like, since Mac OS is based on Unix) created by Richard M. Stallman (a brilliant person) and it offers a big collection of tools that are free software but that is another story, and this takes a big role, that\u0026rsquo;s why is called GNU/Linux, because the kernel is Linux and the operating system is GNU.\nWhat is GNU + Linux? GNU/Linux is a complete operating system that is free and open-source software, meaning that the code is available for everyone to see on the internet, so if anything spooky like spyware be in there it just would be forked (cloned) with that feature removed, so that means that is a secure, fast, and privacy-respecting operating system, is lighting fast since it doesn\u0026rsquo;t have background process that you don\u0026rsquo;t need, and because everyone can code for the GNU/Linux operating systems, known as distros, that is the short word of distributions, and distros are different OSes based on GNU/Linux, there is a wide amount of configuration available thanks to the project being open-source, so if you have a low-end machine there is a desktop lightweight enough for your computer to run smooth as butter! or you can just go crazy and create your own desktop if you want to!\nDistros They are a lot of distros out there, but the one you choose should depend on these factors:\nHow skilled you are with computers? Server or desktop? Low-end or high-end computer? With that type of factors in mind you can choose your perfect linux distro!\nYou can take this image from Anthony Young from Linus Tech Tips!\nNow with that technical introduction, we can go to the important question\u0026hellip;\nWhy should I care? Because linux could be the answer to you! If you have old or low-end hardware, or just windows giving you a lot of blue screens, or you are concerned about your security and privacy, Windows is not going to be the best option, why?\nBecause windows is bloated and difficult to mantain, bloated meaning with full of software you don\u0026rsquo;t want to (like candy crush) and difficult to mantain because the way of installing applications is tedious and that leads to malicious software being downloaded without you even noticing, and that could be answer why of your blue screens of dead, or crashes, or lots of anti-virus that are really spyware, or slowness being of software that steals your computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies for example\u0026hellip;\nWhile linux being really different to windows, is much easier, secure, faster, and reliable, you can\u0026rsquo;t get viruses on linux unless you know what you are doing, so for anyone who does office work (documents, presentations, spreadsheets), web browsing, mails here and there, and that\u0026rsquo;s it, you will be better of with Linux! Just have a little patience for the first days and then you will be good to go!\nBut that doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that linux is only for that type of users, high-end computers and tech-savy users are more than welcomed since here you have the freedom to use your computer completly and the best way possible, your way, is perfect for heavy tasks, like gaming, video editing, virtualization, coding, etc\u0026hellip;\nReally linux is for everyone, for programmers, to grandmas, or office work, really for everyone, and for the gamers too! the gaming world we are a little left behind, because Easy Anti cheat support for linux was just announced today! So we have to wait for easy-anti-cheat games are developed for linux, but these holidays we are going to get the biggest news ever being that the steam deck is released! being the steam deck OS \u0026ldquo;SteamOS\u0026rdquo; based on Arch Linux!.\nShould I switch to GNU + Linux? The answer is totally!\nYour will have a privacy-respecting, a secure and fast computer that manages to get your work done! and you can customize it however you want, and tedious tasks will be easier than ever and the best thing is that is free and open-source software, so no spyware or piracy for that office license that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to pay, here is free, free as in freedom, and free as in gratis, free as in free beer!\nSoon in a new blogpost I will talk about more deeply in distros and how to install Linux on your machine!\n","date":"2021-09-22T18:58:53-05:00","image":"https://saidneder.tech/images/linus.jpeg","permalink":"https://saidneder.tech/blog/penguin/","title":"What is GNU + Linux?

Because windows is really a heavy, full-function, full of software you can\u0026rsquo;t get rid of and don\u0026rsquo;t want in the first place (bloatware), spyware and more creepy stuff that makes windows a really heavy computer operating system that is really slow on the computer we took for example, since windows on idle takes aproximately 3-4 GB of ram, but what if we install a lightweight GNU/Linux distro?\nThat\u0026rsquo;s were the fun begins, you now know that with a lightweight distro that uses aprox. 1 GB of ram and know you have a lot of ram left to spare, and you become more curious and then you installed arch linux with DWM for the minimalist setup with only 500 MB of ram usage on idle, and then you notice that you are faster than before on your windows setup, you use keybindings to navigate faster, and you only have the apps you need.\nThat is the perfect example that we can translate to a life example\u0026hellip;\nIf you have a lot of activities like going to the gym, drawing, work or school, cooking classes, coding sessions and/or reading, without counting social interaction because is an activity we have to work out everyday, you will get burned out and sadly, never progress on all of your activities, why? because you are not dedicating enough time to every activity, and that\u0026rsquo;s why you need minimalism, to progress faster\nApplying minimalism day to day First you need to know your priorities really well, for example a like a lot of things, but I know deep inside what activities are really important in my life, I will take myself for example taking by order:\nProgramming (I want to work on IT and study computer science) School (Obligations) BJJ (Exercise and a way of live) Social circle (Family and Friends) And that\u0026rsquo;s it for me, we are talking about our activities each day, we need to know our priorities to make the cut of certain stuff that is taking time from the activities we really need to invest in, for example, I like to cook, and draw, but they are just \u0026ldquo;hobbies\u0026rdquo; or activities that I enjoy doing but am not going to be a chef or artist, I just like to do them, that\u0026rsquo;s why I leave space for them in the weekends, because from monday to friday you need to be laser focus on your principal activites, and those principal activities, that from now on we are going to call them grind, why? because grind is an activity where you can work tirelessly and see no return because is leading a bigger purpose.\nFor example myself once again, (is not that am ego-centric or something, I just know me better that anyone) I started programming as a hobby, two years ago, and now is something that I live and breathe for, this is my spot, my grind, I have zero percent in return yet, yes I know a lot of stuff, created projects and all, but no one pays me or obligates me to do so, so why I keep doing it? Because it serves a major purpose, you need to see the big screen boy, If it ain\u0026rsquo;t about a dream, then it ain\u0026rsquo;t about me as mac miller used to say R.I.P.\nOkay, now we know our top priority, now what? Time to get to work, This will be your main focus of every day you have, you wake up and you think about that, you dream about it, the first things that you see in your room are about it, that\u0026rsquo;s all you got, you have to bet on yourself because if you don\u0026rsquo;t have that, you really got nothing, you see? You don\u0026rsquo;t have distractions, you don\u0026rsquo;t have other stuff to take out your time, you are dedicated and disciplined, because you are focused only on one thing, and focus on getting good at it, getting obssesed with the process and soon enough to enjoy the return of your major labor, that is minimalism, to not have anything besides your grind, so the only thing that you think about is your grind, concentrate fully on your grind because you got nothing to distract you, and to be patient and knowing that hard work always pays off!\n","date":"2021-09-21T23:13:03-05:00","image":"https://saidneder.tech/images/chill-images/curaray.jpeg","permalink":"https://saidneder.tech/blog/minimalism/","title":"Why minimalism is important in your life"}]
