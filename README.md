# Said Neder's website

### [saidneder.tech](https://saidneder.tech/)

I made it with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) that is a static website generator made
with [go](https://golang.org/), with my own theming made with HTML, Sass, and Javascript!
the repo is completly free and open source, so fork it!

## Content on my website

On my website I will talk about a lot of linux and programming, but not everything
is tech related, I talk about my thoughts too, so better go check it out!

## Code

**Visit the hugo official [docs](https://gohugo.io/documentation/) to understand how
hugo works before reading!**

We will review each part of the code so you can use my code as a starter for your
own webpage!
