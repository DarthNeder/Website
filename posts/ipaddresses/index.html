<h1>IP Addresses</h1>
<p>This is in the third layer of the OSI model that is Network, related to routing.</p>
<p>Inet = IPv4, decimal notation
Inet6 = IPv6, hexadecimal notation</p>
<h2 id=ipv4>IPv4</h2>
<p><code>192.168.57.139</code>
Each group before the dot is an octect, made by 8 bits, representing 1 and 0, and made all up together conforms 32 bits and that is equivalent to 4 bytes.</p>
<p>With that said, there isn&rsquo;t enough ipv4 for the world itself so now we use ipv6.</p>
<h2 id=ipv6>IPv6</h2>
<p><code>2800:bf0:8040:11c4:dd55:372d:7329:176a</code>
The IPv6 is made up of 128 bits that is 16 bytes. is made of the hexadecimal numbers (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,a,b,c,d,e,f)</p>
<p>the quantity of ipv6 that are out there are endless, but still no one uses ipv6, thanks to NAT that is Network Address translation, we are assiging private ip addresses.</p>
<p>And private ip addresses are ip addresses that are only known to you, in your lan, not on the interweb (WAN)</p>
<p>So natting works because all of this privates ip addresses comes out as just one public ip address that is the one that your ISP is renting you.</p>
<h3 id=classes-of-private-ip-addresses>Classes of private ip addresses</h3>
