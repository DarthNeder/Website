<h1>TCP vs UDP</h1>
<h1 id=tcp-udp-and-the-three-way-handshake>TCP, UDP, and the three-way handshake</h1>
<p>Both are layer 4 of the OSI model, that is transport, so this protocols covers the transport of packets to the application.</p>
<h2 id=tcp>TCP</h2>
<p>TCP = Transmission control protocol</p>
<p>Protocol for sending and receiving data</p>
<p>The communication between two computers need to be &ldquo;good&rdquo; and reliable, to guarantee that the data is received correctly, like a webpage or downloading a file, this protocol is used to guarantee that all the data is received and in order.</p>
<p>TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which basically means that it must first acknowledge a session between the two computers that are going to communicate, so the two computers verify a connection before any communication takes place.</p>
<p><strong>First step:</strong>
The first computer will send a SYN, that is message.</p>
<p><strong>Second step</strong>
Then the other computer will send a SYN ACK, that is a message acknowledging the SYN message.</p>
<p><strong>Third step:</strong>
Then the first computer will send a ACK, that is acknowledging the the SYN ACK so now they confirmed that they have a stable connection where data can be delivered.</p>
<p>And that is known as the <em><strong>Three way handshake</strong></em></p>
<p>This protocol guarantees the delivery of the data so if a packet is missing it will re send it and let the other computer know.</p>
<h2 id=udp>UDP</h2>
<p>UDP = User datagram protocol</p>
<p>Protocol for sending and receiving data</p>
<p>UDP is a connectionless oriented protocol, and it does not establish a session and because of that it does not guarantee data delivery, is just sends all the packets, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is received at the end or not.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why is known as a &ldquo;fire-and-forget&rdquo; protocol, but thanks to not guaranteeing data delivery, is much faster than TCP, UDP is used in livestreams, where you want a fast connection that gives you the live moment of your soccer match for example, you don&rsquo;t want to be 10 seconds delayed for a pixel that it wasn&rsquo;t sent as would be in TCP.</p>
